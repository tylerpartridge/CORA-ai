## GPT-5 Progress (2025-08-14)

✅ Read `DIAGNOSIS.md` and `FIX_SPEC.md`
✅ Implemented surgical JS edits in `web/static/js/onboarding-ai-wizard.js`:
  - Forced linear phase advancement (`advanceToNextPhase`) after every user input
  - Captured answers per phase with simplified storage (`captureAnswerForCurrentPhase`)
  - Simplified `updatePhase()` to one clear prompt/UI per phase
  - Fixed signup call to `/api/auth/register` with `password_confirm` and `signup_source`
  - Trigger completion automatically when email + password available

⏳ Test plan:
1. Visit `/onboarding` fresh (clear localStorage)
2. Answer each prompt once (nonsense allowed)
3. Verify no duplicate questions
4. Enter email and password at end; account is created
5. Redirect/CTA to dashboard works

If issues:
- Hard refresh to bust JS cache
- Check network tab for `/api/auth/register` response
