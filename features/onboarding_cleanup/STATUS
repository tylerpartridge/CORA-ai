# Onboarding Files Cleanup Task

## Status: IDENTIFIED - Needs Cleanup
**Created:** 2025-08-14 by Claude
**Issue:** Multiple duplicate/legacy onboarding files causing confusion

## Current Active Onboarding:
- **Route:** `/onboarding` (routes/pages.py:372)
- **Template:** `web/templates/onboarding-ai-wizard.html`
- **JavaScript:** `web/static/js/onboarding-ai-wizard.js`
- **CSS:** `web/static/css/onboarding.css`
- **API:** `routes/onboarding_routes.py` (prefix: /api/onboarding)

## Files That Should Be Removed/Quarantined:

### Broken Routes (missing templates):
- `/onboarding-wizard` route (pages.py:381) - template doesn't exist
- `/onboarding-ai` route (pages.py:386) - redundant

### Duplicate Route Files:
- `routes/onboarding_v2.py` - Why v2? Check if used

### Unused Templates:
- `web/templates/onboarding/welcome.html` (25KB)
- `web/templates/onboarding/connect_bank.html`
- `web/templates/onboarding/success.html`

### Legacy JavaScript:
- `web/static/js/enhanced_chat_onboarding.js`
- `web/static/js/voice_onboarding.js`

### Unused Feature Folder:
- `features/conversational-onboarding/` - entire folder seems unused

### Misplaced Test Files:
- `test_onboarding_flow.py` (in root, should be in tests/)

### Documentation/Prototypes:
- `docs/chat_onboarding_prototype.html`

## Recommendation:
1. Keep only the active onboarding-ai-wizard files
2. Move unused files to `/tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/`
3. Remove broken routes from pages.py
4. Document in CLAUDE.md which onboarding is the real one

## Commands to Clean:
```bash
# Create quarantine folder
mkdir -p tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy

# Move unused files (DO NOT RUN YET - needs approval)
mv web/templates/onboarding/ tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
mv routes/onboarding_v2.py tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
mv web/static/js/enhanced_chat_onboarding.js tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
mv web/static/js/voice_onboarding.js tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
mv features/conversational-onboarding/ tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
mv test_onboarding_flow.py tests/
mv docs/chat_onboarding_prototype.html tools/QUARANTINE/onboarding_legacy/
```

## Note:
This needs Tyler's approval before cleanup. The active onboarding works fine,
but having 5+ different onboarding implementations is confusing.
