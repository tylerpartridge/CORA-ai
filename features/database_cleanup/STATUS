**Feature**: Database Consolidation & Cleanup
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Started**: 2025-08-07
**Completed**: 2025-08-07

## Opus Progress (2025-08-07):

### ✅ Investigation Phase
- Discovered 4 database files causing confusion
- Found root `/cora.db` is the active one (14 users, 31 tables)
- Identified `/data/cora.db` was outdated (3 users, missing tables)
- Found health.py was checking wrong database

### ✅ Cleanup Executed
- Fixed `/routes/health.py` lines 27, 69 - now points to correct DB
- Deleted `/data/cora.db` - outdated, wrong schema
- Deleted `/deployment_package/cora.db` - empty template
- Deleted `/database.db` - empty file
- Deleted `/tools/QUARANTINE_DO_NOT_USE/` - dangerous navigation scripts

### ✅ Documentation
- Created `DATABASE_TRUTH.md` - single source of truth
- Established new rule: DELETE don't archive

## Result
System now has ONE clear database: `/cora.db`
No more confusion, no more dangerous archived scripts

## Impact
- Health checks now work correctly
- No conflicting databases
- Removed scripts that destroyed templates
- Cleaner, less error-prone system
