# Voice Expense Entry - STATUS

## NEXT TASK: Create /api/voice/expense endpoint

## WHERE TO WORK:
- Parser: `/features/voice_expense/claude/job_parser.js` âœ… DONE
- API: `/routes/expenses.py` (add voice endpoint here)
- Contract: `/features/voice_expense/shared/api_contract.md` (follow this spec)

## WHAT EXISTS:
```
/features/voice_expense/
â”œâ”€â”€ claude/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ job_parser.js         # Extracts job names from speech
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration.js        # Shows how to connect parser
â”œâ”€â”€ cursor/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ voice_button.js       # UI button component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ voice_modal.js        # Modal interface
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard_integration.js  # Dashboard connection
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â””â”€â”€ api_contract.md       # UI â†” Backend contract
```

## HOW TO CONTINUE:
1. Read api_contract.md for endpoint spec
2. Create POST /api/voice/expense in routes/expenses.py
3. Import job_parser.js logic
4. Test with: "Home Depot receipt Johnson bathroom three forty seven"

## INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Modifies: `/routes/expenses.py`
- Uses: `/web/static/js/voice_onboarding.js` (existing parser)
- Updates: `/web/templates/dashboard_unified.html` (add button)
