# CORA AI Assistant Enhancement - STATUS

## Created: 2025-07-25 21:00

## Vision
Transform CORA from a chat widget into a comprehensive sales person, onboarding assistant, and support expert that guides users throughout their entire journey.

## Key Discoveries from Multi-Agent Research

### Competitor Weaknesses We Can Exploit:
- QuickBooks: Hidden fees ($6.50-12/month for contractor payments)
- BuilderTrend: Terrible mobile experience ("clunky" with bugs)
- Xero: Only 90 days of support then abandons users
- FreshBooks: Limits phone support to expensive tiers
- ALL: No true AI assistance or voice features

### Hidden Gems Found in Codebase:
✅ Voice Expense Entry - 90% complete at `/web/static/js/voice_expense_entry.js`
✅ WebSocket Infrastructure - Ready at `/routes/websocket.py`
✅ Quick Win Engine - Tax AI at `/tools/quick_win_engine.py`
✅ Notification System - Complete at `/services/notification_service.py`
✅ AI Dashboard Generator - Hidden at `/tools/ai_dashboard_generator.py`
✅ Job Profitability System - Frontend ready
