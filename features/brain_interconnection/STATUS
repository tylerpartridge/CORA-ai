# Brain Interconnection Feature

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
**Created**: 2025-08-13 by GPT5
**Purpose**: Connect CORA's 3 AI brains for unified intelligence

## What Was Done:

### AI Brain Connection (2025-08-13)
✅ Modified `services/cora_ai_service.py` 
   - Added `generate_enhanced_response()` method
   - Integrates Intelligence Orchestrator context
   - Detects emotional state from Enhanced Orchestrator
   
✅ Updated `routes/cora_ai_routes.py`
   - Chat endpoint uses enhanced response for authenticated users
   - Falls back to basic response for anonymous users
   
✅ Created `models/intelligence_state.py`
   - IntelligenceSignal model for cross-brain communication
   - EmotionalProfile model for emotional state persistence
   
✅ Updated `models/user.py`
   - Added intelligence_signals relationship
   - Added emotional_profile relationship

## How It Works:

When a user chats with CORA:
1. Chat Brain checks if user is authenticated
2. If yes, queries Intelligence Orchestrator for business insights
3. Queries Enhanced Orchestrator for emotional state
4. Merges all context into response generation
5. Adapts response based on stress level (simplifies if stressed)

## Testing Required:

⚠️ **MANUAL TESTING NOT YET DONE**

Need to verify:
- Chat responses include business context
- Emotional state affects response tone
- Stress > 7 triggers simplification
- Fallback works for unauthenticated users

## Impact:

This makes CORA unique - the only contractor AI that:
- Knows your business performance
- Detects your emotional state
- Adapts responses accordingly

**This is the differentiator!**
