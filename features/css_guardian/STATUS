# CSS Guardian Feature Status
**Created**: 2025-08-12 by Opus 4.1
**Purpose**: Prevent CSS conflicts and enforce single source of truth
**Status**: üü° IN DEVELOPMENT

## Problem Statement
The navbar font inconsistency incident (3+ hour debugging) revealed:
- Multiple CSS sources competing for control
- rem units vulnerable to global changes
- No automated detection of CSS conflicts
- No enforcement of single source of truth

## Solution
CSS Guardian - automated CSS conflict prevention and detection system

## Components

### 1. CSS Ownership Registry ‚úÖ CREATED
- Maps each component to its authoritative CSS file
- Enforces single source of truth
- Location: `/features/css_guardian/claude/css_ownership.json`

### 2. CSS Conflict Detector ‚úÖ CREATED
- Scans for duplicate selectors across files
- Identifies competing styles
- Detects rem usage in critical UI
- Location: `/features/css_guardian/claude/css_conflict_detector.py`

### 3. Pre-commit Hook ‚úÖ CREATED
- Validates CSS changes before commit
- Prevents nav styles outside navbar.css
- Checks for rem units in critical components
- Location: `/features/css_guardian/claude/pre_commit_css_check.sh`

### 4. JavaScript Style Monitor ‚úÖ CREATED
- Detects JavaScript style modifications
- Found zoom_controls.js and accessibility.js modifying root font-size!
- Alerts on dangerous patterns
- Location: `/features/css_guardian/claude/js_style_monitor.py`

### 5. CSS Health Dashboard ‚è≥ PENDING
- Visual overview of CSS conflicts
- Ownership violations report
- Unit usage analysis

## Implementation Progress

### Opus 4.1 Progress (2025-08-12):
‚úÖ Created feature structure
‚úÖ Built CSS ownership registry
‚úÖ Implemented conflict detector
‚úÖ Created pre-commit hook
‚úÖ Integrated with awareness system
‚è≥ Next: Runtime monitor and dashboard

## Testing
- Run: `python features/css_guardian/claude/css_conflict_detector.py`
- Install hook: `cp features/css_guardian/claude/pre_commit_css_check.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`

## Integration Points
- Awareness Registry: Updated with CSS Guardian capability
- CI/CD: Pre-commit hooks ready
- Documentation: CSS ownership rules documented

## Next Steps
1. Test conflict detector on current codebase
2. Install pre-commit hook
3. Build runtime monitor
4. Create health dashboard

## Success Metrics
- Zero CSS conflicts in production
- No rem units in critical UI
- Single source of truth maintained
- Debugging time reduced from hours to minutes

## Scan Results (2025-08-14)

### What I ran
- `python features/css_guardian/claude/css_conflict_detector.py`
- `python features/css_guardian/claude/js_style_monitor.py`

### Results
- CSS Conflict Detector: PASS (0 conflicts, 0 violations, 0 REM issues)
- JS Style Monitor: FOUND 2 CRITICAL issues modifying `document.documentElement.style.fontSize`
  - `web/static/js/zoom_controls.js` (line ~7)
  - `web/static/js/accessibility.js` (line ~900)

### Recommendations
- Keep navbar/footer on px units (already policy) to immunize critical UI
- Scope font-size changes to a container instead of `documentElement`
- Consider disabling global zoom in production, or feature-flag it

### Next
- Add guardrails in `navbar.css` if needed (single high-specificity font-size rule)
- Audit pages where zoom is initialized; ensure no inline overrides
