Here's the thing though: to show you REAL insights about your profit margins and where you might be leaving money on the table, I need to see patterns across several jobs.\n\nThe contractors using me are finding an average of $2,000 in missed deductions their first month. But that comes from tracking real data, not guessing.\n\nReady to start tracking? I'll help you log your next job in under 2 minutes. Let's go! [complete_onboarding]"
