# ðŸ“‹ Migration Summary: .ai/ â†’ .mind/

**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Key Finding
The `.ai/` directory referenced in documentation did not exist. Instead, we organized existing documentation and planning files into the new `.mind/` structure.

## Directory Structure Created
```
.mind/
â”œâ”€â”€ today/                 # Current focus & active work
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ current_focus.md  # (from NOW.md)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ session.md        # (new - today's session log)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ status.md         # (from STATUS.md)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ next_tasks.md     # (from NEXT.md)
â”œâ”€â”€ maps/                  # System architecture & design
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ system_structure.md     # (new - complete file map)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai_architecture.md      # (from README_AI_SYSTEM.md)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ save_system_design.md   # (from SAVE_SYSTEM.md)
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/              # (empty - for future historical data)
â””â”€â”€ MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md  # This file
```

## Files Migrated

### To .mind/today/
1. `NOW.md` â†’ `current_focus.md` - Active task tracking
2. `STATUS.md` â†’ `status.md` - System health status
3. `NEXT.md` â†’ `next_tasks.md` - Upcoming features
4. Created new `session.md` - Daily session tracking

### To .mind/maps/
1. `README_AI_SYSTEM.md` â†’ `ai_architecture.md` - AI collaboration guide
2. `SAVE_SYSTEM.md` â†’ `save_system_design.md` - Save/restore design
3. Created new `system_structure.md` - Complete project map

### Files NOT Migrated (Remain in Root)
- `app.py` - Main application (needs root access)
- `start_cora.py` - Startup script (needs root access)
- `CORA_V4_PLAN.md` - Version planning (reference doc)
- `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` - Deployment guide (reference doc)
- `HUMAN_TRAINING.md` - User training (reference doc)
- Other utility scripts and config files

## Benefits of New Structure
1. **Clear Separation**: Active work (today/) vs architecture (maps/)
2. **Ready for Archival**: archive/ folder ready for daily backups
3. **AI-Friendly**: Follows the save/restore system design
4. **No Sprawl**: Clear boundaries and organization

## Next Steps
1. Update `README_AI_SYSTEM.md` to reference `.mind/` instead of `.ai/`
2. Implement auto-archive script for daily backups
3. Create `.mind/conventions.md` for coding standards
4. Set up automatic session tracking

## Notes
- Original files remain in place (copied, not moved)
- Consider removing duplicates after verification
- The 300-line limit applies to files in .mind/today/
