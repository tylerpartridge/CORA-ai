# ðŸ§  CORA: The Complete AI Business Brain

## What CORA Really Is

CORA is not just a bookkeeper. She is your company's **complete AI business brain**:

### Her Expertise Spans:
- **Business Planning** - Strategic advisor who understands your goals
- **Financial Advisory** - Investment strategies, cash flow optimization
- **Tax Planning** - Proactive tax strategy, not just filing
- **Bookkeeping** - Yes, she does this too, but it's just the beginning
- **Legal Advisory** - Business structure, compliance, contracts
- **Integration Expert** - Native compatibility with all AI systems

## The AI-First Differentiator

CORA isn't trying to replace human advisors with AI. She's building something new:
- **AI-to-AI native** - Other AIs naturally connect with her
- **Personal AI compatible** - Your assistant can query CORA directly
- **API-first architecture** - Built for the interconnected AI economy

## The Vision Evolution

**Old positioning**: "AI Bookkeeper"
**True positioning**: "Your AI Business Brain - handles everything from bookkeeping to board meetings"

She's not a tool. She's a team member who happens to be AI.

## Key Messaging Points

1. **"CORA does what a CFO, CPA, lawyer, and business advisor do - but 24/7"**
2. **"The only AI that other AIs trust with financial data"**
3. **"From bookkeeping to board strategy - one AI, total understanding"**

## Implementation Note

Bookkeeping is our wedge, but every feature we build should reinforce that CORA is a comprehensive business intelligence system, not a single-purpose tool.
