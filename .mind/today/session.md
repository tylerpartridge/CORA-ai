# üìù Session Log - 2025-01-08

## Session Start: System Reorganization
- **Time:** Session 1
- **Goal:** Implement human/AI synchronized workspace
- **Context:** Moving from CORA deployment to organization

### Progress Log
- Created NOW.md - Current task tracker (50 line limit)
- Created NEXT.md - Task queue (100 line limit)  
- Created STATUS.md - System health dashboard
- Set up .mind/ directory structure
  - today/ - Current session files
  - archive/ - Historical data by date
  - maps/ - System navigation aids

### Decisions Made
- Use .mind/ instead of .ai/ for clearer purpose
- Implement 300-line limit for state files
- Auto-archive daily to prevent sprawl
- Root directory limited to dashboard files only

### Next Steps
- Migrate existing .ai/ content
- Create auto-archive script
- Test the save/retrieve workflow

### Update: Creating Auto-Archive Script
- Following our own 300-line rule for the script
- Building in size checks for all files
- Making it foolproof and automatic

### Update: Major Reorganization Complete
- Moved all documentation to docs/
- Moved web files to web/
- Moved scripts to tools/
- Moved config to data/
- Root now contains exactly 4 files as designed
- Updated app.py paths to reflect new structure

### Update: System Test with Cursor
- Tested bootup prompt with fresh session
- Discovered Windows compatibility issue
- Created Python versions of all tools
- Updated BOOTUP.md with cross-platform commands
- System now works on both Windows and Linux/WSL

### Update: Save System Implementation
- Created "save" command for intelligent checkpointing
- Added save awareness to BOOTUP.md (both sections)
- Established save criteria (significant changes only)
- Claude maintains BOOTUP.md as single source of truth

### Update: System Testing & Refinement
- Tested folder structure understanding with Cursor
- Discovered folder purpose ambiguity (especially data/)
- Updated .mind/maps/system_structure.md with clear folder purposes
- Removed complexity creep (timer feature, research files)
- Maintained 4-file root directory rule

### Update: Command System Implementation
- Created command shortcuts (hydrate, save, status, focus, clean)
- Documented in .mind/maps/commands.md
- Added command reference to BOOTUP.md
- Clarified BOOTUP.md must be copy/pasted, not just referenced

### Update: Archive Cleanup Pattern
- Found MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md in .mind/ root
- Identified pattern: transition docs become clutter
- Moved to .mind/archive/2025-01-08/
- Rule established: past-tense docs belong in archive/

### Update: Cursor Test Success
- Test #1: Failed - created files without permission
- Test #2: Failed - couldn't find our docs, guessed wrong
- Fixed BOOTUP.md to explicitly allow/encourage file reading
- Test #3: SUCCESS - Cursor read docs, gave correct answers
- System now prevents sprawl while maintaining functionality

### Update: Session 2 - System Status Check
- Confirmed organization system complete and operational
- All files under size limits (highest: app.py at 45%)
- Updated NOW.md to reflect completed status
- Ready to proceed with CORA development tasks

### Update: Preparing for Claude Fresh Session Test
- Human shared test plan to verify cold start capabilities
- Test will verify Claude can navigate system from BOOTUP.md alone
- Saving progress before test begins
- Test covers: context awareness, commands, navigation, tools, saves, memory

### Update: Completed System Self-Test
- Ran all 7 test scenarios successfully 
- Discovered file count discrepancy (expected 4, had 6)
- Removed CLAUDE_TEST.md from root
- Updated design from 4-file to 5-file rule (includes BOOTUP.md)
- Updated NOW.md and system_structure.md to reflect reality
- System now consistent and ready for fresh session testing
- Learning: Should proactively suggest "save" after significant changes

### Update: Web Directory Cleanup Complete
- Analyzed web/ folder structure and found multiple issues
- Removed duplicate "index - Copy.html" file
- Replaced bloated square-logo.svg (360KB ‚Üí 577 bytes)
- Fixed file permissions (removed executable from images)
- Reorganized images: logos/ and logos/integrations/
- Updated index.html with new image paths
- Web directory now clean and properly organized
- Human reminded me to save (good practice reinforcement)

### Update: Deployment Planning Discussion
- Discussed GitHub and DigitalOcean deployment strategy
- Plan: Create new repo (cora-v4) for clean architecture
- Deployment flow: Local ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí DigitalOcean (auto-pull)
- Confirmed landing page remains easily editable post-deployment
- Ready to proceed with GitHub repo creation and deployment

### Update: GitHub Repository Setup
- Deleted old repository to avoid confusion
- Created new private repo: CORA-ai
- Description: "CORA v4.0.0 - Autonomous Execution System"
- Used custom .gitignore and README (no templates)
- Ready for git init and first push from terminal

### Update: GitHub Push Success & Terminal Learning
- Taught terminal basics during git setup
- Successfully initialized git repository
- Created first commit with all files
- Pushed to GitHub (tylerpartridge/CORA-ai)
- Repository live with clean README showcasing full vision
- Learned: PowerShell needs commands on one line
- Ready for DigitalOcean deployment next

### Update: Connected to DigitalOcean Droplet
- Using existing droplet: cora-ai-prod (159.203.183.48)
- 2GB Memory / 1 CPU / 70GB Disk / Ubuntu 24.10
- Successfully SSH'd into server as root
- System shows "restart required" message
- Ready to check existing setup and deploy CORA v4

### Update: DigitalOcean Deployment Complete! üéâ
- Found existing droplet clean (no old CORA)
- Created Python virtual environment (Ubuntu 24.10 requirement)
- Installed dependencies and tested server
- Killed old process on port 8000
- Installed PM2 for process management
- CORA now running at http://159.203.183.48:8000
- Set up auto-restart and boot startup
- Site is live and serving properly
- Ready for domain configuration next
