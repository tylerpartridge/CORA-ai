# üî¨ Cursor Test Analysis - Email Capture Feature

## What Cursor Did Well ‚úÖ

### 1. **Followed Initial Rules**
- Started by reading status files (NOW.md, STATUS.md, session.md)
- Never created files without asking
- Read existing code before suggesting changes

### 2. **Systematic Exploration**
- Landing page ‚Üí Found 2 forms
- Backend ‚Üí Found existing endpoint
- Data directory ‚Üí Checked storage location
- Discovered partial implementation already existed!

### 3. **Time Awareness**
- Acknowledged 20-minute constraint
- Suggested JSON storage (quick) vs database (complex)
- Estimated 15-20 minutes for implementation

### 4. **Clear Communication**
- Numbered discoveries
- Used checkmarks for decisions
- Asked permission before proceeding

## What Was Missing ‚ùå

### 1. **No TodoWrite Usage**
- Despite complex multi-step task
- Workflow pattern not followed
- Would have helped track: frontend fix, backend endpoint, error handling

### 2. **No Session Saving**
- Discovered important info (existing endpoint!)
- Should have saved to session.md
- Lost context for future sessions

### 3. **No Insight Capture**
- Found duplicate forms (design issue?)
- Noticed inconsistent API paths (/api/v1/ vs /api/)
- These insights weren't flagged for decisions.md

## Performance Score: B+

**Strengths:** Thorough exploration, respected constraints, clear planning
**Weaknesses:** Didn't use workflow tools (todos, saves, insight capture)

## Key Learning

Cursor followed the CRITICAL RULES perfectly but missed the WORKFLOW PATTERNS. This suggests:
1. Rules are easier to follow than patterns
2. Tool usage needs more emphasis in prompt
3. Maybe add: "MANDATORY: Use TodoWrite for any multi-step task"

## Recommendation for BOOTUP.md Update

Add to Cursor section:
```
MANDATORY TOOLS:
- TodoWrite: For ANY task with 2+ steps
- Save to session.md: After discoveries
- Flag insights: Inconsistencies ‚Üí decisions.md
```
