# ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Insight Capture Framework

## When to Capture Insights

### High-Value Triggers
1. **"I wish..."** statements â†’ Future improvements
2. **"What if..."** questions â†’ Vision expansion
3. **"I learned..."** reflections â†’ Workflow optimization
4. **"Next time..."** comments â†’ Process refinement
5. **Casual brilliance** â†’ Off-hand comments that reveal deeper patterns

### Capture Decision Tree
```
Is it actionable? â†’ decisions.md
Is it aspirational? â†’ vision files
Is it procedural? â†’ workflow_patterns.md
Is it preference? â†’ tyler_preferences.md
Is it temporary? â†’ session.md
```

## How to Capture Without Bloat

### The Compression Rule
**Raw conversation:** "Maybe we should think about how CORA could talk to other AIs"
**Compressed insight:** "AI-to-AI communication priority"
**Filed in:** cora_true_vision.md

### Strategic Filing
- **Immediate use:** Current session files
- **Future reference:** .mind/maps/
- **Big picture:** docs/ (only when solidified)

## Test Scenario Proposal

For our Cursor stress test, let's try:
1. **Complex feature:** Add email capture to landing page
2. **Multiple files:** HTML, Python backend, data storage
3. **Real complexity:** Form validation, error handling, success feedback

This would test:
- Multi-file coordination
- Todo management for complex tasks
- Save points during implementation
- Insight capture from debugging
- Meeting/decompression after

Ready to test our refined workflow on something meaty?
