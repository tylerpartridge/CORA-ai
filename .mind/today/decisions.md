## Architecture Decisions

### File Size Limits
**Decision:** 300-line maximum for all state files
**Reason:** Prevents overwhelming both human and AI
**Impact:** Forces regular archiving and clean structure

### Directory Structure  
**Decision:** Use .mind/ instead of .ai/
**Reason:** Clearer metaphor - this is our shared mind/memory
**Impact:** Better mental model for collaboration

### Root Directory
**Decision:** Only dashboard files in root (NOW, NEXT, STATUS)
**Reason:** Root = command center, not storage
**Impact:** Always clean, always navigable

### Save Strategy
**Decision:** Multiple small files vs one large state
**Reason:** Faster retrieval, targeted updates
**Impact:** More granular but more organized

### Save Command System
**Decision:** Single "save" command for checkpointing
**Reason:** Simple for human, intelligent evaluation by AI
**Impact:** Prevents both over-saving and missed milestones

### BOOTUP.md Ownership
**Decision:** Claude maintains both sections of BOOTUP.md
**Reason:** Claude has full system view, Cursor focuses on code
**Impact:** Single source of truth, consistent updates

### Folder Documentation Location
**Decision:** Document folder purposes in .mind/maps/system_structure.md
**Reason:** Avoids adding files to root, keeps system knowledge centralized
**Impact:** Clear folder purposes without violating 4-file root rule

### Transition Document Handling
**Decision:** Migration summaries and transition docs go to archive/
**Reason:** They document past events, not current state
**Impact:** Keeps .mind/ focused on active work only

### Save Timing Decision
**Decision:** Proactively suggest "save" after significant changes
**Reason:** Prevents work loss, maintains session continuity
**When to save:**
- After completing a major task
- After system structure changes
- After running tests/validations
- After resolving issues or inconsistencies
**Impact:** Better work preservation and clearer progress tracking

### CORA Positioning Decision
**Decision:** CORA is a comprehensive AI business brain, not just bookkeeper
**Reason:** Bookkeeping is the wedge, but vision is total business intelligence
**Scope:** Business planning, finance, tax, legal, bookkeeping, integrations
**Key differentiator:** AI-to-AI native - built for AI assistant economy
**Impact:** All features/messaging should reinforce comprehensive capability
