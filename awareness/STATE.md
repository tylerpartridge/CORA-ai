# CORA System State
*Last Updated: 2025-08-23*

## CURRENT SPRINT
**Focus**: Bulletproof systems before launch
**Priority**: File protection, awareness systems, backup automation

## MVP STATUS
**Progress**: 53/65 items (81.5%)
**Recent Wins**:
- ✅ Stripe webhooks fixed (200 OK)
- ✅ Remember Me login (30-day sessions)
- ✅ Database relationships mapped
- ✅ Full CRUD API operational

**Remaining Critical**:
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset implementation
- [ ] Production deployment automation
- [ ] User onboarding flow

## SYSTEM HEALTH
- **Production**: coraai.tech (DigitalOcean)
- **Database**: SQLite (cora.db) - operational
- **Payments**: Stripe webhooks working
- **Auth**: JWT tokens, 15min/30day sessions
- **Backups**: Automated system installed

## ACTIVE ISSUES
1. AI awareness files deleted (2025-08-22)
   - Recovery: Backup system implemented
   - Protection: Files now immutable
   
2. Git push failures (large files)
   - Solution: Pre-push hooks installed
   - Backup: Automatic before push

## COLLABORATORS
- **Opus 4.1**: System architecture, awareness
- **Sonnet 4**: Feature implementation, testing
- **GPT-4**: Code review, alternatives

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Complete awareness bootup system
2. Test email verification flow
3. Deploy latest fixes to production
4. Begin user testing phase

## CONTEXT NOTES
- Post file-loss recovery mode
- Building bulletproof systems
- No feature work until systems solid
- Full awareness required for AI
