# ðŸŽ¯ NEXT - Vision, Strategy & Roadmap

## ðŸŒŸ North Star
**Mission:** Simplify expense tracking with AI-powered insights for small businesses  
**Vision:** Become the intelligent financial assistant every small business owner trusts  
**Why CORA Exists:** Small business owners waste 5+ hours/week on expense management. We give them that time back.

## ðŸš« What We're NOT
- NOT a QuickBooks replacement (we integrate with it)
- NOT an accounting system (we're the AI layer on top)
- NOT enterprise software (we love small businesses <50 employees)
- NOT complex (simplicity > features, always)

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics & Milestones
