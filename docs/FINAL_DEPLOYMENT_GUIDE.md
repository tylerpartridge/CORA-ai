# CORA Final Deployment Guide

## 🎉 System Status: BETA READY (Local) - Production Route Issue Identified

**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** 🔧 Core system fully operational locally, production route registration needs investigation  
**Next Step:** Fix production route registration, then complete final verification

## ✅ What's Working (Tested & Verified Locally)

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Health Endpoint**: `GET /health` - Returns system status
- ✅ **API Status**: `GET /api/status` - Returns uptime and system info
- ✅ **User Registration**: `POST /api/auth/register` - Complete flow with validation
- ✅ **User Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` - JWT token generation
- ✅ **Password Reset**: Complete flow with token generation and validation
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Full UI with stats, users, feedback, onboarding
- ✅ **Onboarding System**: Checklist, progress tracking, feedback collection
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite with 15 expense categories, all tables created
- ✅ **Backup Script**: `tools/backup_db.py` - Automated database backups

### Admin Features
- ✅ **System Stats**: Total users, active users, expenses, feedback count
- ✅ **User Management**: List all users with status and creation dates
- ✅ **Feedback Analytics**: View all user feedback with ratings
- ✅ **Onboarding Stats**: Completion rates and progress tracking
- ✅ **User Details**: Individual user analytics and recent activity

### Security Features (Working)
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Ready for production domain restriction
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Fixed with custom exception handler
- ✅ **Security Headers**: Middleware working properly
- ✅ **Request Logging**: Middleware operational
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Global exception handling configured
- ✅ **Database Backup**: Automated backup script with scheduling guide

## 🔧 CURRENT ISSUE: Production Route Registration

### Problem:
- **Protected routes** (admin, onboarding, feedback) returning 404 in production
- **Environment-specific** - Routes work locally (77 routes registered) but not in production
- **Application startup** - Health and status endpoints work, but protected routes not registered
- **PM2 environment** - Issue appears specific to production PM2 environment

### Investigation Results:
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware fixed and working
- ✅ All route files import successfully locally
- ✅ Database connection and models working
- ✅ Core authentication endpoints working
- ❌ Protected route registration failing in production environment

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to DigitalOcean
```bash
# SSH to production server
ssh root@coraai.tech

# Update codebase
cd /root/cora
git pull origin main

# Install any new dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Restart PM2
pm2 restart cora
pm2 save
```

### 2. Troubleshoot Route Registration Issue
**If protected routes return 404:**

1. **Check PM2 logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs cora --lines 50
   ```

2. **Verify application startup**:
   ```bash
   pm2 status
   ```

3. **Test route imports in production**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from routes.admin_routes import admin_router; print('Admin routes imported')"
   ```

4. **Check Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   pip list | grep fastapi
   ```

5. **Verify file permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la routes/
   ```

### 3. Enable Security Features
After confirming the deployment works:

1. **Verify middleware is enabled in `app.py`**:
   ```python
   # === SECURITY & LOGGING MIDDLEWARE ===
   setup_rate_limiting(app)
   setup_security_headers(app)
   setup_request_logging(app)
   setup_error_handlers(app)
   setup_user_activity(app)
   ```

2. **Restart the application**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart cora
   ```

### 4. Set Up Automated Backups
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily backups at 2am
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /root/cora/tools/backup_db.py
```

### 5. Enable 2FA on DigitalOcean
- Follow the guide in `docs/SECURITY_HARDENING.md`
- Save backup codes securely

## 📊 Beta Launch Checklist

### Technical (After Route Fix)
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify all protected endpoints work
- [ ] Enable security middleware
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Enable 2FA on DigitalOcean
- [ ] Test all endpoints in production
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard access

### User Experience
- [ ] Test complete user journey: register → login → dashboard
- [ ] Verify onboarding checklist functionality
- [ ] Test feedback submission
- [ ] Confirm email sending (if enabled)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Sentry error tracking
- [ ] Monitor PM2 logs
- [ ] Check database backups
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting and security headers

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Routes Still Return 404
1. **Check application startup logs** for import errors
2. **Verify route registration** by checking OpenAPI docs
3. **Test route imports individually** in production environment
4. **Check for middleware conflicts** that might prevent route registration
5. **Verify PM2 is running the correct code** and environment

### Database Issues
1. Check `data/cora.db` exists
2. Run `python init_db.py` to recreate tables
3. Verify backup script works: `python tools/backup_db.py`

### Admin Access Issues
1. Ensure user is registered and active
2. Check JWT token is valid
3. Verify admin endpoints are accessible

## 📈 Next Steps After Beta Launch

1. **Monitor User Activity**: Use admin dashboard to track engagement
2. **Collect Feedback**: Monitor feedback submissions and ratings
3. **Scale Infrastructure**: Consider PostgreSQL migration for larger user base
4. **Feature Development**: Based on user feedback and analytics

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **User Registration**: Track signup completion rates
- **Onboarding Completion**: Monitor checklist completion percentages
- **User Engagement**: Track login frequency and feature usage
- **Feedback Quality**: Monitor feedback ratings and categories
- **System Stability**: Monitor error rates and uptime
