# 🚀 CORA V4: Foundation for Autonomous Business Intelligence

**Vision**: CORA evolves from an AI bookkeeper into a fully autonomous business intelligence system that learns, grows, and operates independently.

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11
**Vision Holder**: Tyler

## 🎯 Mission Statement

CORA isn't just software. She's the first truly intelligent business system that:
- Learns from every interaction
- Grows more capable over time  
- Eventually operates autonomously
- Creates value beyond her programming

We're not building a bookkeeping app. We're building the foundation for artificial business intelligence.
