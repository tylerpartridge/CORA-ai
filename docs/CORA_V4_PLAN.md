# CORA V4 - Clean Rebuild Plan

**Version**: 4.0  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-07  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-07 (Major Landing Page Refinement)
**Previous Versions**: v1-v3 resulted in 400+ files and circular dependencies  
**Goal**: Minimal viable product that generates revenue

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

Build only what directly contributes to getting paying customers. Every file must justify its existence.

**NEW VISION**: CORA as the interconnected financial AI that becomes your business's financial brain - connecting to everything, available everywhere, getting smarter with every connection.

## 📁 Architecture Decisions

### Naming Convention
- All files include version in header comment
- Clean names (app.py not app_v4.py)  
- Clear attribution in every file:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Cora Version: 4.0
# Created: 2025-07-07
# Purpose: [specific purpose]
```

### Current File Structure
```

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (already decided)
- **Templates**: Jinja2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (when needed)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Email**: SendGrid
- **Deployment**: DigitalOcean + Docker
