## Implications for Cora
- **Entry optics:** Cora at $49 sits beside Contractor Foreman's "starts at $49" and above Jobber Core at $39 ($29 annual). To win, we must:  
  - sharpen differentiation (voice-first, mobile-first, job-centric expenses), and/or  
  - de-risk adoption (longer trial + instant value moments in onboarding).
- **Pricing shape:** Per-user competitors create space for **simple, predictable crew pricing** (non-per-user anxiety).
- **Regulatory comms:** Add an in-app/email explainer ("Heads up: 1099-K shifts to $2,500 in 2025") to build trust and retention.

## Hypotheses to test (after manual walkthrough)
1) **Pricing experiment:** Solo $29 / Crew $69 / Business $149 (60-day trial).  
2) **Invite loop:** Crew invitations + mobile capture to drive shared adoption.  
3) **Messaging:** Replace "AI bookkeeping" with "hands-free voice capture"; add trust signals (privacy, uptime, testimonials).
