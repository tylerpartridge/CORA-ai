I feel like I have waited a long time to have this conversation with you three because in my mind you three are the
0:07
avengers of entrepreneurship on the internet and for very different reasons. You do very different things. You have
0:12
very different perspectives. You run very different businesses. But that is why I've been so looking forward to this
0:18
conversation. Before we get into some of the technical stuff and really specific topics, I wanted to start with a more
0:23
broad question. You're all entrepreneurs. you will speak to and educate millions of entrepreneurs on your own channels in your own rights.
0:30
And the question I wanted to start with is from a psychology perspective and a mindset perspective,
0:37
what does it take to be an entrepreneur? And can anyone listening to this right
0:43
now become an entrepreneur, a successful entrepreneur? I'm going to throw that
0:48
question across the table first. Can anyone become an entrepreneur?
0:54
At the basic level, if a kid can go around a neighborhood and say, "Hey, I will mow your lawn or I'll rake your leaves
1:00
or I'll babysit your kid uh in exchange for money." Fundamentally, it's entrepreneurship if we're just taking it
1:05
at the most basic level. And so, what prevents someone from doing that? Basically, if you can get a job, then you can be a self-employed entrepreneur.
1:11
And so, I would say that is like my baseline number one from a behaviors perspective. Then you get into, okay, I
1:17
want to learn about the game of entrepreneurship. And then there it's basically a lifelong journey of how much leverage can I apply to this um at all
1:24
all pieces of the business because even going around knocking on a door and saying hey can I be a babysitter you
1:29
have all levels of business all all functions of the business still exist there. They're just done a lot of times simultaneously and at very low leverage.
1:34
So you have some level of advertising you went up you knocked on a door you have some sort of presentation that you give in exchange for money and they agree okay great we have a selling you
1:41
know component to it. Um, then we have some sort of delivery that's going to happen, which is like I might chub with my human body and then take care of this
1:47
other human body and make sure they don't die, right? And probably have a couple other things that I might clean the house while I'm here as a little value ad. And then fundamentally, it's
1:53
like that's a complete that's a complete cycle of exchange. And then, you know, maybe they leave a review because you start have a website, but that starts to
1:59
create leverage and then then you expand from there. But I think fundamentally at the most basic level, that is entrepreneurship. And then everything else is just more.
2:05
Cody, you can be an entrepreneur if you're willing to tolerate pain. I I think being an entrepreneur is largely a
2:11
byproduct of three things. One being how much pain can you tolerate? Two being how consistently and three being can you
2:18
take the consistent pain that you have and find a way to decrease it which just means can you learn from the things that
2:23
you've gone through as an entrepreneur. By and large it is a hard path because
2:30
uh at the end of the day you can't blame anybody else and there's a scoreboard constantly behind you. And so, you know,
2:37
if you if you have a job, it could be the boss. It could be the other decisions. It could be somebody else's fault. But if if you are the
2:42
entrepreneur in charge, there's nobody else. And the thing that I love about entrepreneurship, and I think all
2:47
entrepreneurs love, is you either win or you lose. In a lot of ways, it's a zero- sum game. And it's measured
2:53
predominantly by do I grow my profits and and revenue in the way that we set
2:58
up this the system today. So, yes, I think anybody who is willing to tolerate pain can become an entrepreneur. And I
3:05
think it's actually okay to have pain in your life and you should seek it a little bit. Same thing as the gym. We
3:11
don't go in there and think it's going to feel great to have a workout and have our muscles literally rip apart in order to rebuild. And yet that's what it takes
3:19
in order to get more fit. And so um I think part of the game of
3:24
entrepreneurship is just like can we increase pain tolerance over time consistently? And once you do that, then
3:31
the things that used to be hard today, you'll look back on and you'll sort of chuckle because they will not be hard any longer.
3:36
So there's various types of pain in my life that I'm not willing to tolerate. And there's other types of pain that I've like volunteered to choose over
3:43
long periods of time. So I'm trying to understand, and this is just a question to all of you, we'll get into Daniel straight after is
3:49
how do I know what pain is worth tolerating and over a long period of
3:54
time? Because some pain is not good pain. some pain is not worth it. How do I know what pain is worth it?
4:00
Well, I think that's what comes into that third level of you have to be able to be on a a journey to decrease the
4:07
pain, which is learn. Like that's what learning means. Like you try something, you touch the stove once, you realize that the stove burns you when you touch
4:13
it, you don't do it again. If you continue to touch the stove continuously over time, then you haven't really learned. Um, but you know, I mean,
4:20
there's lots of different types of pain. There's acute pain, which is like you feel it in this moment really, really deeply and intensely. And that in
4:26
entrepreneurship often is things like I've completely run out of money. Nobody is going to fix this problem. I'm the
4:32
last one on the line. And then there's a type of pain that is low-grade pain. So kind of consistent over time. I have to
4:38
work harder. Every single Friday there's a you know a paycheck that I have to give somebody else. That's sort of
4:43
consistent pain. And I think in entrepreneurship we should assume you're always going to have some version of
4:49
lowgrade pain. I had pain when I worked in the call center and I have pain now. Did you have
4:54
acute pain when you worked in the call center? It was just drudgery and boredom and low. You are out of alignment. So when
5:01
you have an origin story, a mission and a vision and you feel an alignment between your past, your present, your future, and you feel excited about the
5:07
future that this is working towards, then the pain becomes meaningful. And what you're looking for is pain that
5:12
is in alignment with origin, mission, and vision. So meaningful pain, meaningful pain. What do you think? What do you think
5:17
about that same question about can everybody be an entrepreneur? And what does it take from a psychology perspective? I'm I'm asking this
5:23
question because there's people at home that are going to wonder. They're they're in a job at the moment. They're pondering a lot. They see people like
5:28
you three who seem like you're a million miles away, but you didn't start a million miles away. So, what does it take to be successful
5:35
at the highest level? In the comments of every one of these videos is not everyone can be an entrepreneur. Not everyone wants to be
5:40
an entrepreneur. Interestingly, uh the idea of a job is a very recent
5:46
innovation if you take a long view of history. Uh jobs really only came into existence around the 1850s. is the idea
5:51
of a wage. Prior to that, people got paid for tasks and essentially you completed a task, you got paid and all
5:58
sorts of levels of society and that gave rise to very entrepreneurial classes of people. Uh you had to be quite
6:03
entrepreneurial prior to the 1800s. So it's definitely built into us. Uh I personally think that the human brain
6:10
has three kind of levels. The base level is very concerned with survival. It's fight, flight, freeze, freak out. The
6:17
next level up is just interested in status quo and it's interested in repeating the past and doing what's safe
6:23
and just doing what's comfortable. And then there's this other part of us that is a visionary and it's interested in
6:29
exchange. It's interested in empathy, strategy, love, compassion, adding value to others and it's it's a higher mind.
6:35
It's a higher way of thinking. Unfortunately, what happens in most of society, especially with a lot of um
6:41
social media and especially with the way we were raised through the schooling system, is that we keep get just getting
6:47
dragged back into the autopilot and the reptile brain uh as opposed to being able to have a little bit of time for
6:53
the visionary. And it's that visionary mind that makes you feel very entrepreneurial. I have seen people who
6:59
have never had a business. They've never been entrepreneurs and they get around a group of entrepreneurs and the buzz and
7:06
the energy from that group of entrepreneurs becomes contagious and they start opening up this other part of
7:11
their mind and they go, "Oh, wait a second. I've got an idea. I could do this." And they start thinking about what's possible. And I've watched people
7:19
go from I could never do this to I could totally do this in a day.
7:24
Alex, you wrote something down there. It was when you were talking about, you know, what kind of pain, you know, is
7:29
there? And I think there's a a classic, um, example of when do I push and when do I pivot? And so, um, pivoting comes
7:36
from, at least from my perspective, where you have an underlying assumption that your original thesis was based on
7:42
that has been disproven. So, if I say, hey, I want to start, you know, um, a doggy toothbrushing business.
7:49
Um, you know, there's an underlying assumption that people are willing to pay for their dogs to get their teeth brushed, right? Um and within the
7:56
context of like I have presented this in a way that follow the normal persuasive you know taxes of uh you know this is
8:02
the benefit you know these are the these are the prices that I would need to charge in order to make a profit etc. If I find out that no one cares about this
8:09
then that would be a moment where I would say I don't think you should push harder I think you should consider pivoting. The pushing scenarios is
8:14
typically when your underlying thesis is still is still true. You have not invalidated that and so you just haven't
8:20
figured everything out yet. Um, and most of that is where the pain comes in. Um, that that Cody is referencing. Now, I
8:26
think the third door where it gets really tricky is that there's opportunity cost. And I think this is where most entrepreneurs get trapped.
8:33
And in some ways, rightfully so, because, you know, it's very, very hard to build a successful restaurant that's
8:38
local. And if you want to be a trillionaire, it's probably not the way to do it. And so, what happens is you develop skills, you know, developing
8:45
your first opportunity. You figure out how to do doggy toothbrushing. you find out that people don't actually care as much about brushing their dog's teeth,
8:50
but they do care about their dog having good breath and being, you know, clean and groomed or whatever. And so like, so
8:56
you pivot a little bit and then you're doing this thing, but then you have these big aspirations of being a trillionaire. And you're like, I don't
9:02
know if I can turn this into being a trillionaire, but I did learn how to market. I did learn how to sell. I did learn how to manage. And then you think,
9:08
okay, well, should I start an AI startup? You know what I mean? As my next thing, because I did develop all these skills.
9:14
So now what do I do? Right? And I think a lot of people are in uh maybe you know one step later entrepreneurs are in this
9:19
camp where they're like okay I didn't understand the world as well. Now I understand different opportunity vehicles have different returns but also
9:24
risk associated with them. All of them require pain and work. And so if pain is basically I can only interpret pain as 1
9:31
to 10 and 10 out of 10 restaurant days will still suck as much as 10 out of 10 AI software days. But this one has a
9:37
billion dollar payout and this one has a $2 million payout. Well, if I'm going to suffer either way, I might as well do the thing that gets me the best return,
9:44
which is good entrepreneurial thinking, but then so is focus and so is longevity. And so then what do you do,
9:49
right? And so, um, and so I I I just thought about that from a pain perspective because you have
9:55
a lot of times the pain happens from insufficient volume. Like you think that this like this business isn't working, but it's realized it's usually because
10:00
you're not working enough. Um, and when I say that, I mean doing enough in it. So it's like, hey, I knocked on 20 doors and like no one wants this. It's like,
10:06
well, obviously with 20 doors, you have no idea if somebody wants it or not. It's like knock on 2,000, you'll probably get a better idea. And so, but
10:12
most people like have never had rejection before and so they think 20 is a sufficient amount. Um, or like, hey,
10:18
there's no good there's no good engineers in insert city. It's like, well, how many did you interview? You'd keep talking and eventually it's three.
10:23
And you're like, okay, well, no I mean, if you're going to marry somebody, do you think you'd only go on three days? And then just say, I guess I have to pick from one of these. So, it's
10:29
probably not a good idea. And so, I think the same idea of insufficient volume is one of the things that can that can create pain, you know, for
10:36
entrepreneurship. you have opportunity cost of like, okay, well, now there's the green, the grass is green over there. Should I stop what I'm doing now,
10:42
right? And then you have kind of underlying thesis, which absolutely if you have your underlying thesis for the business that is disproven, then that's
10:48
one of those times where it's probably worth pivoting. But for anybody who's listening who's a newer entrepreneur, my my big my ask to you would be I probably
10:55
wouldn't start an AI uh startup caveat as my first business. And what I mean by
11:01
that is like if I as in building an actual tool now if you want to like implement AI using other people's tools
11:06
that's a different thing but the first business that you start you're going to be learning the game of business even more than you're learning the business
11:12
that you're doing. And so then once you learn the game of business then you start to see kind again you start to see more clearly the opportunities that
11:18
exist. The next step for me in what Alex said was about how do I know which idea is
11:24
worth pursuing. Alex was saying there that which I completely agree with is that the first thing you do is actually teaches you the fundamentals of how
11:30
business works. Team building, marketing, promotions, customers, customer service. But for those people
11:36
that are sat at home and they have an idea and they're mulling whether that is the idea worth pursuing, is there a framework for knowing if it's a good
11:42
idea or a bad idea? What we use that comes from private equity. If you want to know if your business is going to make you money or
11:48
not or investable or not, we use the moat strategy which is basically M stands for margin. So you want a
11:54
business that actually makes you money, doesn't just generate revenue. And so a good business typically has at least 15%
12:00
net margin. So that's the money you put in your your pocket, right? So that's profit. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And then uh the O stands for
12:07
operations. So operations being can this thing actually scale over time or will I really have a job not a business?
12:13
And what's the difference there? The difference between the two is if you have a job not a business that might be for instance without AI. If my entire
12:20
business was just me talking continuously to camera and I'm an actor. It's really hard to turn acting to a
12:26
business, right? You're trading time, right? You're still an employee. You're just self-employed as opposed to a
12:31
business owner. And there's a real difference between a CEO and a self-employed person. And then the A stands for advantage, which is, do I
12:38
have an unfair advantage in my business? I think over time all arbitrage windows close. So if you don't have some sort of
12:43
advantage, it's hard to stay in business over a long time. An advantage might be I have distribution because I have social media so I can get more eyeballs.
12:50
I can figure out how to talk to 2,000 people quickly because I can do it via video as opposed to knocking on 20
12:56
doors. H or it could be logistics or it could be uh 10 years of experience in an
13:01
industry. And then the T stands for TAM total addressable market which goes back to the doggy teeth issue which is you
13:08
know is this a real market that enough people are interested in that I can build a business that is big enough for
13:13
me? And you know, to Alex's point, I don't think everybody should try to play the trillion or billion dollar uh game.
13:20
In fact, I think it can be quite miserable to to strive for billions. And so the the total addressable market for
13:27
your local fruit stand in your community may be a perfect amount of income for you, but let's actually know what amount
13:33
of income is reasonable for you. And the cool thing about entrepreneurship in like today's age, the data is available
13:39
everywhere. And so in private equity, you would take this model like that. So you'd go moat, you would I take them and for each one I
13:46
rank them one to 10 and businesses. So margin, operations, advantage, total addressable market. Each one of them a
13:53
10 is perfect, a one is the worst you could have. And businesses that are
13:59
better than 30 across all four, well that's a fund it. That's a fundable business model. Businesses that are less
14:05
than 30 but more than 20, that's a fix it. You've got some problems in the model. And businesses that are less than 20, that's a flee it. this is probably
14:12
not right for you and a hard business to do. I think it's not just the people who are looking for a new opportunity or people
14:19
who don't currently have a business. I personally think at the moment every single person on the planet who has a business should assume that their
14:25
business is on borrowed time because AI is going to disrupt everything and in that disruption everyone has the
14:31
opportunity to rethink whether they want a different opportunity or whether they want to pivot. It's the perfect time. I look at simple things when I'm thinking
14:38
about is it a good opportunity. I think every good business is built upon somebody's case study. So when I look at
14:45
not just businesses as a thing on their own, I think businesses as a thing on their own have to be taken in
14:50
consideration with who's the entrepreneur. So your entrep like something that's a great opportunity for Cody may be just a disaster for me and
14:57
like and likewise. So I'm looking at the background of the entrepreneur. Do you have a case study to leverage? Do you have knowledge? Do
15:04
you have a network? Do you have resources? Have you got a reputation in something? because those are the things that we can then leverage. And then I'm
15:10
just going to have a look at three little things. I'm going to say this idea that you've got going forward.
15:16
Does this address someone's pain? Right? Is there some sort of problem that this solves? And that we could measure that,
15:23
right? Because people pay to move a metric. They love to move some sort of a number. So is there a pain that we can measure and can I take people out of
15:29
that pain based on my story? The next thing is does that type of person who I'm going to solve that for,
15:35
do they have money to spend? because ultimately 60% of all the money is in the top 10%. So the top 10% have about
15:43
60% of the available disposable income. So groups that t tend to have money is
15:49
business owners, executives, people who've got accumulated wealth. Um you
15:55
know, so you're looking at like some sort of indication that you're selling to a group of people who have money. Underneath that top 10%, Amazon's
16:01
already got them, McDonald's has already got them. Like that's a saturated part of the market. you were looking for that top 10% who've got disposable income.
16:09
And then the final part is passion. Like are you passionate about this? And my definition of passion is a willingness
16:15
to suffer. So it's not do you get joy from it, not are you super happy from it. It's are you willing to suffer for
16:21
this? Are you willing to have delayed gratification? Um would an objective third party who looks at your behavior,
16:28
who looks at the way that you show up in the world, would they agree that you seem to be willing to push through
16:33
difficult times in order to have this? So those are some of the conversations I'd have with anyone and not just people who are starting out, people who have
16:39
already got a hundred million dollar business. It's like the adult marshmallow test basically. Yeah, I think Cody had a had a great
16:45
framework in terms of thinking about this from an investing perspective for the people who are considering starting their first business. I like the pain,
16:51
passion, profession angle of like typically it'll be something that comes from a personal pain that you overcame. Whether it's you had an eating disorder
16:57
or you have kids who have allergies and you figured out how to pack lunches or you figured out how to store stuff for twice as long because of some unique
17:04
thing that that you retrofitted a cooler with whatever some passion which is just like a hobby that's that's you're deeply
17:10
interested in or it's a profession. of something that you already currently do. Like in a way, this is I think one of the easiest self- entrepreneur, you
17:16
know, self-employment path is just going from employed to self-employed doing the same thing that somebody already pays
17:21
you for. So like you don't need to worry about like market risk of like I wonder if accounting is still going to be
17:26
desired by other people like right now because everyone's so interconnected like remote work and being able to be
17:32
fractional like many people can start kind of mini consulting businesses doing you know because a lot of businesses and
17:37
entrepreneurs are very um bad at allocating resources and so they have a lot of quote full-time employees that
17:43
are working 20% of their effort and still keep you know keeping their paycheck and at the end of the day like they do enough to keep their job but not
17:49
so much that they are nearly at their full discretionary effort. And so all of a sudden you think, okay, well, I could
17:54
probably do the same work for half the price and the entrepreneur be willing to pay it, but I could do that same work for half the price for five times the
18:00
people and make three times as much and do it on my own time. And so that becomes, I think, a great like foray into entrepreneurship. Now, what do you
18:06
have to learn there? It's like, well, you already have delivery down because you already do the job. You just have to learn how to promote. It's just like how do you reach out to people and ask them
18:12
if they want what you have and then get them to trade you money for it. Um, that like at least takes half of it out of the equation. almost all three of those
18:18
pain, passion, profession, you already have kind of the back end. Like you have the pain, you figured out the thing. Uh the passion, you've already spent all
18:24
this time loving this thing. So you've already done a lot of the the work and research. And so really, you just need to learn the front end, which is like
18:30
how do I promote and how do I sell, right? How do I get someone to give me money for it? And then in terms of um
18:35
how much money you make, I think Danny had a great perspective of like, you know, sell the rich, like they're the ones who have the money. And if you uh
18:40
sell to rich people, you get to sell at rich people prices, which is more fun. Uh, and so I mean I'll give you a simple
18:47
example. Um, I have a CRO company that that we do a conversion rate optimization across our sites in our
18:52
portfolio. And so if that company works with an e-commerce business and they, you know, add 10% to, you know, topline
18:59
and goes from 1 million to$ 1.1 million, they make $100,000 of value. If they work with an e-commerce business that's doing $100 million a year and they do
19:04
the same exact work and they add 10%, they add $10 million a year. So it's a hundred hundred times more in terms of
19:11
value that's being created. And so fundamentally you have the value to create your ability to negotiate a slice of that pie. How unique that is as in
19:18
for example I could have plenty of sales guys are like hey Alex I could sell millions of dollars of stuff for you. I'm like yeah but so could every other
19:23
salesperson. So you have significantly less uh you know negotiating power even if you have the negotiating skill just
19:30
because many other people can do it right. And then the third the the final component is risk and that's the one that I would multiply everything by
19:36
which is how much risk you take on. People often say this idea of selling to the rich, but as you explained it there, what what it actually sounded more like
19:42
is sell to the person who's going to yield the most returns from your skill. And I I reflect on this because I spent
19:48
the first half of my career doing social media marketing. I think I said this when we sat down, Cody, that I used to work with fast
19:54
fashion companies or fashion companies. And the net return for the client
20:00
of me selling them all dresses was tens of thousands. I then left that business and spent two years working in
20:05
psychedelics in the biotech industry where if this was around the game the meme stock thing where if they could
20:11
galvanize people on social media to care about their stock the upside the swing was billions of dollars. I was the only
20:18
employee in this biotech firm that ended up listing on the NASDAQ for $3.2 billion. And so their remuneration to me
20:26
for the six months contract was many many many many many millions. Yeah. because they they made billions.
20:34
So for me, they they thought they were ripping me off. Yeah. And and I think about it, funny enough, when you put the same company on
20:39
different stock markets, the the company is worth wildly different. And I think the same about our skills where think about the stock
20:47
market where you're trading your skills. I've got a I got a small example of that. Really small example. There was a
20:52
guy who we worked with who was an occupational health and safety uh consultant. and inside the workplace in
20:59
a typical office he would charge a couple of grand a day uh to go in and it was about 10 days so about 20 grand to
21:04
do an occupational health and safety and I asked him the question what is the most dangerous workplace you've ever
21:09
worked in and he says well there's this type of manufacturing that has lasers freezing stuff boiling stuff lava you
21:16
know the sharks you know the whole thing right whatever it is and not actual sharks but you get the idea and I said
21:23
do you know how to solve the problems of that workplace and he says I absolutely know how to fix those problems. I said,
21:29
"Why don't you position yourself and why don't you run a campaign that you're one of the best in the world for that and
21:35
that you're actually going to just run a campaign around that?" Um, within a year, his day rate had gone to 20,000 a
21:42
day from 2,000 a day and a typical engagement had gone up to 400 grand. Mainly because he went from, you know,
21:50
the same skill set, but he applied it to a a much, you know, more valuable environment. Podcasting is somewhat
21:56
similar, you know, because if I podcast in the UK, the amount of money I get per
22:01
view from YouTube is half versus if I do the same activity, the same amount of
22:07
effort, the same amount of hours in the United States, the platforms pay me double for the same amount of views. And
22:12
I think many of us are like trying to get a pay rise from our boss or whatever, but actually thinking about are you trading your skills on the
22:18
highest return market is a great way. We I used to hire writers at my old company and those writers would be paid, you
22:24
know, 30 40 $50,000 whatever it was in the UK. When when I was working in biotech and we were looking for someone
22:30
that could write about biotech, it was a quarter of a million the salary. It was five times more for the same fundamental
22:36
skill of writing. I think that I think that a lot of times when you're starting out as a brand new entrepreneur, it's scarier to sell to
22:42
rich people. You're like, I don't know rich people. I'm not a rich person. I'm going to sell to my friends. That is very normal. That's the people that you
22:48
have the closest proximity to. But the problem is is that means you have to play the volume game. And the volume
22:53
game is actually really hard. It's hard to get a lot of people to buy your thing. Incredibly difficult. It's
22:58
actually much easier to get a few rich people to buy your thing. And so, you know, we had this home inspection
23:03
company and I didn't know it at the time, but he was telling me they were having like major cash issues in their business. And
23:10
uh and I could kind of tell because when an entrepreneur is under stress, like you can sort of see it, you know, it's a it's a a visual thing, too. and he was
23:17
about 45 days away from uh running out of cash. And when I was sitting down and talking to him, I was trying to understand his business. Home inspection
23:23
has been around forever. It's a normalized business. This business works. It functions. It has good margins. It's a rollup for private
23:29
equity. The business model is not the issue. So, what was the issue? The issue was their clients and their pricing. So,
23:36
he was trying to be the home inspector for everyone at a lower price point. And
23:41
what does that mean? It means it was actually really hard for him to advertise because he wasn't niching down. He was competing with all of the
23:46
major players and he had very little margin because he was competing for
23:52
people who couldn't afford very much in their home inspection costs. We made one change which is we just said in front of
23:58
his business name and in all of his ads luxury home inspections instead of just
24:03
San, you know, San Diego home inspections or whatever city he was in previously. And that one change
24:08
increased his margins by 45% and they saved his business. He didn't do more volume. He didn't hire more people. He
24:15
didn't get smarter. He didn't get better. He just sold to rich people instead. And because that increased the
24:21
surface area that he was covering. So each house was like, I don't know, thousands of dollars instead of a couple hundred bucks to inspect, his business
24:28
was saved forever. And so I I think protecting your profit is so crucial
24:33
when you start a business. And nobody tells you that because it feels safer to sell things cheaply to people who don't
24:39
have very much money. But there's that old adage which is, you know, try to work with a $50 client and they will
24:45
say, "I need everything under the sun for this $50 I'm going to give you." And then go to a $50,000 client and they'll say, "Wire sent." And so, you know,
24:53
in the beginning, go for the 50,000. I think when you um when you're starting out, you a lot of times you sell out of
24:58
your own wallet to to Cody's point. So, it's like you have no dollars in your wallet, so you assume everyone else has no dollars in their wallets either.
25:04
And you're so afraid of getting rejection that you continue to lower the price until you get here. you hear people say yes, but just as like a
25:11
benchmark for people who are starting out is that like usually you're appropriately priced when seven out of 10 people are saying no. Um that's like
25:18
about the appropriate price. So if you have like if I you know see a business and they're doing 80% close rates as in like 80% of uh the people they talk to
25:25
say yes, they usually have a double or triple in pricing just sitting there. If they're at like 60% close rates, they
25:30
usually have a one and a half to 2x price increase that's sitting there. If they're at, you know, 40 to 50, they've
25:36
got a 50% price raise in there. And if they're right at that, you know, 30-ish 35%, then they're usually appropriately priced. And if they're at 20, they just
25:42
need to learn how to sell better. But and so, but fundamentally, I say this because usually, you know, in the beginning of entrepreneurship, you're so
25:48
afraid of hearing no. Um, but the reality of it is that you need to be
25:54
hearing no more than you hear yes to know that you're being appropriately priced. When you look at uh this this
25:59
little pyramid of customer segmentation, you get 1% of people who have 15% of the budget, 9% of people have 45% of the
26:06
budget, 90% of people combined 40%. Right? So when you actually break that
26:12
down, you have one person willing to pay 15 grand, you have nine people willing to pay 5 grand each, and you have 90
26:18
people willing to pay 445 each. So you are almost always better off going I
26:25
think the best place for most small businesses to go is that 9%. And the reason is the top 1% typically shop on
26:31
pedigree. They want to work with the best businesses out there. They want to win work with the ones who have won awards and the ones that have been
26:37
around for a long time relationships and and through trusted relationships. The 90% they shop on price. They have a
26:43
fixed price and they only want to shop on that price. The 9% shop on passion. They want to follow someone who's an
26:50
interesting uh who has an interesting new take on things, who's putting together a group, who's done some education or entertainment around it. So
26:57
the this 9% I would call that the affluent niche and that affluent niche is really good place to start.
27:02
And that 9% are the ones that are closest to moving into the 1%. So you can grow with a client over time, which we saw a lot.
27:08
You could help get them up to the 1% and then then they'll take you and introduce you to all the others. What skill that
27:13
you currently have would get you back to being a hund00 million entrepreneur? I think there's two different ways you
27:19
could do this. One would be promotion. So, are you an incredible salesperson to go direct to a ton of people? The other
27:25
way is partnerships. And I think you can think of these different ways. Promotion could be BTOC often, which is like going
27:31
direct to consumer. Um, often partnerships is B2B going to a few big people. Um, I think of partnerships as
27:37
employment, which is a very fast way often to make money, too. like Jack might make way more millions with you
27:43
than he does individually. And so my background when I didn't have any cash, I didn't know how to go to people
27:48
directly. I didn't know how to do paid ads. I wasn't sure how to do promotion, which is a volume game that you have to
27:54
be good at. So I went towards partnerships. I said, I can get to fewer, bigger, faster. I can't get to
27:59
many fast. And so I think there's like two paths to making money quickly if you
28:05
don't have any. And and the first path has less risk, but perhaps midsize returns. And that is go find the best
28:12
entrepreneur, founder, business builder you can find who you can still get to on a daily basis in some way and go work
28:18
for them. Learn as much as you can, earn as much as you can. As you learn more, ask for more continuously over time.
28:24
This is how I mean Cheryl Sandberg is one of the richest people in the world and she's never had her own business, right? She's only worked for other
28:29
people and she's doing just fine. So I think that's the first way and that would be what I would call partnerships or employment. And then the second way
28:36
is to go do it yourself, right? which is high risk but probably highest reward. And in that instance, you have to go and
28:42
figure out how to get people to buy your things continuously over over time. But like when I didn't have money in the
28:47
beginning, um you know, I had just I'd gotten out of finance. I didn't want to work for somebody else again. I was
28:53
pretty miserable. I had worked for a billion hours for people in investment banking and asset management. And uh I
29:00
had massive golden handcuffs. Like I made a lot of money. And um I had no brilliant idea. I didn't have a business
29:05
idea. I had no idea what to do next and I'm pretty riskaverse actually. I was like way too scared to go do do what you
29:11
guys all did which is start businesses from scratch. And so instead I partnered up. I went to another company that
29:17
needed to raise capital and get a few investments in it. And I went to them and said I can raise money from a few of
29:23
these people that I know. If I do that, can I negotiate a little bit of equity in the company? Can I negotiate upside
29:28
return for the money and dollars that I bring in? And I want to I want to be a partner in the company. And so you don't
29:34
always have to start your own thing. If you can negotiate with partnerships, I think sometimes you can skip to the front of the line if you're not a great
29:41
natural salesperson, you know, or marketer. And so you really just need to decide which one. And neither of them
29:47
are better than any others. They're just better for you. The amount of resources you have access to is a factor of knowledge, network,
29:54
and reputation. So you're at all times you're trying to build your knowledge. You're trying to build your network.
30:00
You're trying to build your reputation. Now, a lot of people are worried about the knowledge, but they've probably done
30:05
interesting things already in their history. They probably if they looked over the last 3, four, five years, they could say, "Actually, I've done all
30:10
sorts of things, but I've never told anyone about that, right? I've never actually explained to I've never posted on LinkedIn. I've never posted an update
30:16
telling people what I've done. So, therefore, I've actually got things that could build a reputation, but I've never
30:22
leveraged that reputation." If you're a young person, especially, network is actually you've got a superpower with
30:28
network. And I'll tell you why. Because if you go to a private bank that normally banks people with 3 million,
30:34
but you say, "I want to be an entrepreneur. I want to come to some of your entrepreneur events that you host, they'll bring you along cuz you're
30:40
you're an ambitious young person." If you go to a large accounting firm and say, "Do you ever host big events? Could I attend some? Can I jump on a
30:46
newsletter that lets people know about the events?" They'll invite you along. And I'm talking about like Ernston Young and KPMG. Every single week, they've got
30:54
some thing that they're doing in their offices. They've got experts, they've got rich people, they got all that sort
30:59
of stuff happening there and they'll invite you along. So, you've got this ability to build your network. You got
31:04
this ability to leverage uh your reputation. I actually don't think that
31:10
you can make good decisions about the knowledge on your own. I think you need someone who's at the higher level to
31:17
tell you this is the skills you should go for. These are the things you should do. So, for example, at the time that
31:22
Alex did ads, it was a great time for doing ads. But now fast forward to today, it's probably better to study AI
31:29
and and to bring that to the table. So sometimes those rep sometimes those things change. So let's say you figure
31:35
out what is your reputation? What can you talk about when you're in front of people, you go networking, you go to a
31:41
few of these events, you outreach, you get yourself in front of some people, and you actually ask the question, what kind of skills do I need? What what sort
31:47
of um I need to build my skills? I need to build my knowledge. What do you think would be a valuable thing uh to do? because people who are at that next
31:53
level up, they're they're noticing what they what they need. Uh they're noticing what's hot, what's not. Um so they're
32:00
going to be able to teach you or or guide you. And and um to Cody's point, you know, you you want to have a mentor
32:05
in your life. You want to have someone who's who's been there, done it. You want to, you know, partner with a bigger
32:11
organization and get some of those. Before Kim Kardashian was Kim Kardashian, she was Paris Hilton's uh
32:16
assistant and she learned the playbook for being famous for being famous. and then she took it to a new level. Took it
32:23
to a new level. So she she uh she did an apprenticeship and then she applied the apprenticeship.
32:28
One of the things that all of us have in common is we make content. If you guys were starting from zero today
32:34
with AI in the picture and all of these platforms and the way things are going, I I spent I've spent a lot of time
32:40
thinking about the next big opportunity in content and I think about the next big platform. Where would you be
32:45
starting today based on who you guys are and the skills that you have and the
32:50
things you're interested in is probably a better way of saying it. Would you be on LinkedIn posting once a day? Would you be on Tik Tok making videos? Would
32:57
you be on YouTube starting a channel? Would you start a newsletter? And with AI in the picture, I think it
33:02
changes the answer because content is going to become very easy to make. So where does the value acrew to? like
33:09
where does the value move to in a world where every kid a kid in Mumbai could make a real or a quote picture now with
33:16
chat GPT so where is the value going to acrew and how are you going to milk that cow how are you going to capitalize like
33:22
what is the one thesis you have about the future of content that you haven't told anybody yet we talk about social
33:28
media and I think um there's been a lot of talk about it shifting really more towards interest media rather than social media right so I think this is
33:34
extremely important because what what Cody was referencing earlier is again entertainment ment versus ed education.
33:40
And so Rihanna and Drake I see both as entertainers. Now what's interesting is that where do they have influence? So
33:47
she used the word intent but fundamentally I say like how do we increase the likelihood someone complies with the request or complies with the
33:52
solicitation right? If I tell you to do something one I mean we've all seen some creators who have tiny audiences but if they say hey go do this thing you know
33:58
they have 100% not really 100 but they have a huge conversion on a very small audience. And then other people, you know, I I can name some Tik Tockers
34:04
right now that have, you know, 50 plus million, uh, followers that have had 13 failed launches because they have views,
34:11
but they have zero influence. No one listens to them for their advice. And so, um, in order to create
34:17
influence, there's four things. So, number one is, and so I just remember SPCL, right? So, you have status. So,
34:22
somebody who controls scarce resources. So, a bartender at a bar, there's alcohol behind them. It's a scarce resource. In the bar, they have status.
34:28
When they walk outside of the bar, no one cares about them. But in the bar they have status, right? So that g so they give influence. The second is
34:34
power. And so power is basically um say do correspondence meaning if I tell you
34:40
to do something follow these instructions and a good thing happens then you I I'll increase the likelihood that you comply with request in the
34:46
future. And so like for example Martha Stewart uh was the first self-made female billionaire. And I think there's
34:52
there's a huge amount of reasons for that. And one of the biggest ones is that she literally gave people recipes and they followed the recipes and they
34:58
had a good thing happen. And then people told them they were great and this cake was great and this lasagna was amazing.
35:03
Their family, their friends, they got they also got status. So a massive good thing happened after following explicit directions. And so then when she said
35:09
follow my next directions and by this thing people said okay the last 10 times I did it it worked. I'll do this too.
35:15
And so that's why she had so much influence. The next is credibility which is do you have proof right now? All of
35:21
these can um happen at the same time or separately. So I'm trying to give more isolated examples for each of them but like one thing can check multiple boxes.
35:27
So, if I say, "Hey, I sold a company for $46.2 million." I have money, which is where the status comes from, but I also
35:33
have credibility that the stuff that I do works. I wouldn't have power yet, though, until I say, "Hey, if you take
35:39
what you're currently doing and then add a bonus, urgency, scarcity, a guarantee, you know, think about a value equation.
35:45
All of a sudden, you can sell it for way more money." And then you follow those instructions and then you do make more money. Then you're like, "Now I'll be
35:51
more likely to comply with this person's request in the future." And so then that person gains influence. And then the the fourth L is likeness, right? Do they
35:57
look like me? Right? Do they act like me? Which is both, you know, physical but also psychographic. Like, do they have they share the same values as me?
36:03
Are they similar? And so, if I have two people that both have SPC, so they have status, they have power, they have credibility, and then one of them just
36:09
also looks like me, I'm more likely to listen to that person. So, each of these are additives. So, if you have all four, you'll be more influential, right? And
36:14
so, um, lading this back up to conversion, we think, okay, well, if I'm going to make content with a purpose of
36:20
conversion, then I want to make stuff that demonstrates these four things, right? Right. And so that is why educators typically have significantly
36:26
smaller audiences, but can usually generate a lot more money than entertainers can. And entertainers
36:32
typically can monetize almost exclusively through sponsorships as the most efficient means or vehicle. Now, where does an entertainer have
36:39
influence? Rihanna is beautiful. And so she does have credibility in
36:46
terms of beauty. she does have. Um, and then especially if she starts making content around that stuff, she takes her
36:52
entertainment audience, but she's talking about something she has credibility to and then she can add power to that because people start following what she does, right? And then
36:58
they start looking a good way and then they say, you know what, she really does know what she's talking about here. And then all of a sudden, when she does point people to, you know, to to a thing
37:04
that that that they can buy, then they're more likely to do so. And so it's it's it's how do we merge those two
37:10
things together? And then when we're making the content, and I think a lot of people we're starting out are very obsessed with views, which I would strongly recommend, especially in this
37:16
interest media time that it's it's so irrelevant. And what I mean by that is if we think, all right, I want to I want
37:22
to start a a bait and tackle drop shipping business, whatever, right? You for for fisherman. Well, if I just start
37:29
making videos on philosophy, I might get way more views than I do if I make, you
37:34
know, videos on bait and tackle stuff. But the likelihood that the people who are watching philosophy also want bait
37:39
and tackle is very low. And because the content is now the targeting for social, like if if anyone's run ads before, you
37:46
have to select, okay, I think I want 42 year olds and I want, you know, men and I want, you know, whatever, right, as you go through it. But the thing is is
37:51
that the algorithms are so good and the AI is so good at understanding what the content is about. And they also know what type of people consume this type of
37:57
content, they just do the targeting for you. And so if you want to reach a certain type of person, you just only make content that that certain type of
38:03
person wants to consume. It's actually easier now than it was before. And so you can have a 40,000 person audience, but that 40,000 person audience might be
38:09
made up entirely of fishermen who buy tackle, which I'll bet you you'll crush. And so, um, that is how I kind of see
38:16
the the the quote future of of media at least, um, is that if you want to have maximum persuasion or conversion power,
38:24
we want to make content that is explicitly for a specific audience. And we want to demonstrate the proof that
38:29
we've done, right? We want to have things that they want. We want to give them instructions that they follow that good things will happen for them. and we
38:34
want to look like them. And if you do that, you have somebody who's going to make a lot of money from an audience. That last point is super interesting as
38:40
well. How do I make myself look more like my audience? And I think relatability and humanizing yourself is one of the
38:48
great ways to do that. I think it's a very fair point. I mean, I also think it's not just physical
38:54
traits. So, you know, let's say that you don't look like the audience that you
39:00
want physically. what are the values that that audience has that you can have them see themselves in you and and you
39:06
know it's kind of like whether or not you like the guy who cares but let's say you know Trump for instance really looks
39:13
not a lot like his audience predominantly you know in suits and ties constantly sort of a blueblood
39:19
billionaire from the east coast how does he associate with this group of people where really he doesn't look like them on average well it's because they
39:26
believe that he has a similar moral compass to them they believe that he has similar ethics to them. And so I don't
39:31
think that creators have leaned into this enough. And I don't mean to become clickbaity or political or or divisive
39:36
or anything like that. I mean that it is rare to see people in business h take a
39:42
stance that could hurt their business values, for instance. And Chris and I have a rule which is we don't have close
39:47
friends that haven't done something publicly that could be against their best interests. I I just don't want
39:52
friends that don't have that that haven't done that because I think that the world is really hard and I want to
39:58
see if somebody's going to have like moral fiber before I become quite close with them. Super interesting.
40:03
Yeah. And so I I think you could do that as somebody who is a content creator today like be value aligned with your
40:11
users and show that and um also to the point about the algorithm becoming about
40:16
interest based. It's also becoming value based. We're seeing echo chambers emerge around ways of thinking, right?
40:21
Well, I the content that I saw of you that most interested me was when you were talking about um how important
40:29
ownership is and you were talking about just the philosophy of ownership and you said there's a group of people who want you to own nothing and be happy about
40:35
it. And I was like I really resonate with that. I want people to own their businesses and I want them to own their
40:40
stuff. And I liked the fact that you were standing in front of a huge audience taking that position and everyone knew that it was a little bit
40:47
of a a position to take and it wasn't specifically content about how to build a business, but you were sharing
40:52
something about yourself. I have a belief you don't actually ever sell anybody anything. You only find those who are already predisposed to
40:57
want the thing that you are selling. And if you believe that, then I think your business gets easier too. Easier to
41:02
target people. That's why I never kind of got off on that content. You know, it's really big online on sales where it's like here's how you close them, you
41:08
know, here's how you do this. Here's how you you switch them and you give them a hot dog and then they buy the car because you gave them the hot dog
41:14
because of reciprocity and you're like, "Huh, I've never bought a car because somebody gave me a hot dog." But apparently this is what works on
41:21
Instagram. And so I don't think that's actually true. I think you just find people at a trigger moment that they want something and then you give it to
41:27
them. Mhm. Regarding content, for me personally, I find that the only reason I'm going to
41:32
create content is if it's in alignment to a mission that I've got. So I don't actually want to create content. I don't want to be out there naturally. I would
41:39
much rather be a way more private person. Um, and you won't you won't find
41:44
a lot of stuff about my family or my my kids, my you know, very rarely do I post anything like any of that sort of stuff.
41:51
But for me, I do it in alignment with the mission. I really believe that if you're on a mission, you've got something you want to achieve in the
41:56
world, you're going to need other people to believe in it. You're going to need other people to get involved. Um, you're going to want to hire talented people.
42:02
Those talented people are going to want to, you know, see you online first. And it's all about the building relationships at scale. And content is
42:09
just people discovering someone new like you would a friend and then getting to know someone. And I think the big play
42:15
in a postAI world is having really deep relationships with a lot of people using
42:20
long form content uh where you share who you are, what you're about, what's your mission, what's your origin story, what's your
42:26
vision, um what are your values? And people then say, "In a very noisy world, I will pay
42:33
attention to what Steven says." Before we move on to a little game that I've prepared for us here, um I you're
42:39
all very good at pitching and you all have your own frameworks for pitching. So I wanted to to pause on that for a second. What is Daniel, what is your
42:45
framework for pitching a business or an idea? There there's two things to start with, which I believe that entrepreneurship is
42:52
the journey of a thousand pitches. That basically what we do as entrepreneurs is we pitch stuff into existence. Um, and
42:59
the penalty for an average pitch is that you do a thousand pitches and you get nothing to show for it at the end of it.
43:05
And the payoff for a great pitch is that you do a thousand pitches and you end up with 10 to$100 million. You end up with
43:11
an amazing team of people and lots of customers and everything everything's great. So I think treat entrepreneurship
43:16
as the journey of a thousand pitches and also treat pitching as this magical
43:23
thing where you get what you pitch for and you can't switch it off. So for
43:28
example, if you say the economy is bad, the economy is bad, the economy is bad, as if by magic the economy is going to
43:34
be bad. Uh if you say I'm seeing lots of opportunities right now, I'm seeing lots of opportunities right now. You you
43:40
start conversations where people go, oh I I've seen an opportunity as well. So, whatever you're out there talking about,
43:46
you tend to bring those conversations to the surface and then it's a self-fulfilling loop. With that said,
43:52
you have to have a framework for pitching. If you're going to do a good pitch, it's got to be a framework. I've got social pitching framework, scheduled
43:59
pitching framework, and sales pitching framework. So, social pitch, name, same,
44:04
fame, pain, aim, game. What's a social pitch? Social pitch is on social media.
44:10
Yeah. or um in a social situation, it's basically a situation where you've got about 30 seconds before someone thinks
44:17
that you're being uh too obtuse. Okay? Right? So, you've got about 30 seconds
44:22
of people's attention. And you're going to say, "What is your name? What are you the same as that they already understand? What makes you famous or
44:28
different? Uh what are you aiming for right now? What's your bigger game? Or what pain do you solve? What are you
44:33
aiming for? What's your bigger game?" So, there's a few things you can put in there and it rhymes so you can remember it in a in a social situation. scheduled
44:40
pitches, I always do something called capstone. And it's clarity, authority,
44:45
problem, solution, traction, or the why, either way, opportunity, next steps, and
44:52
an emotional ending. Right? So, that spells out capstone. Now, is that the
44:57
best pitching framework? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe there's better frameworks. But the point is is that you've got a
45:02
framework that you're not just winging it. You're not just, you know, randomly spewing words. you've actually gone
45:08
through the process of thinking through your pitch uh in a framework approach. One thing that's really fascinating is
45:13
the three of us have a framework for everything like we we're just like very framework thinkers and I've noticed that
45:19
with a lot of entrepreneurs. Um do you guys have pitching frameworks? Be shocked if you didn't. Yeah, I do. I mean I think I'm like lazy
45:26
intellectually and frameworks help you remember things and so if I you don't have very good memory then it's just easy to put it in something that can
45:33
make sure that you remember it. That's why when we were in school, you know, they used to make us sing songs about how to remember the varian states. If if
45:40
if I wanted to raise a bunch of money from other people that didn't know me and I wanted to never have a problem
45:46
raising money again, I didn't want to use any of my money ever, I would use what I learned in venture capital, which
45:51
is the mightest touch. And and basically, I think you need one of these
45:56
four in order to raise money. You don't have to have all four, but if you do, that makes it really really easy. The
46:02
easiest one is profit, right? If you have a business right now that's making money profit in your pocket, you can
46:07
raise capital. You can raise money from people as long as that amount that you're raising is reasonable to the
46:13
amount of profit. If you don't have any profit, but you have growth, let's say like Replet we were talking about a big
46:18
AI company, great. You can raise a bunch of money if you got growth, too. The third thing, if you don't have either
46:24
one of those, you don't have profit, you don't have growth, but you have a history. I've sold a company before.
46:29
I've built this before. you can raise purely on the fact that you've done this before. And if you haven't done any of
46:34
those three, you've done nothing in life, then you need a really good story. And the story is something that you can often raise money off of. So I believe
46:41
that we are going to create the next XYZ. And if we do this thing, then you will all make money, I will make money, and we will change the world together.
46:48
And so I call it the minus touch because I think people who accum if you can accumulate this over your life, it's not
46:53
that hard, right? So eventually at some point you'll have a a history which is your proof. Then you can craft a story.
47:00
You'll get better at it as you continue to grow. You will learn how to get profit in some way. And because you've
47:06
driven profit before, you'll know how to get growth. So I think like almost any entrepreneur over time, if you focus on
47:11
those four things, can raise money and you start with only the story when you have nothing.
47:18
Alex, I have a lot of pitching for um I I'll say first and foremost like if
47:24
you're trying to sell anyone anything, um proof will always be promised. And I can say that, you know, a thousand times in a row. Like you could literally say
47:30
nothing, get on stage and then just hit next on testimonials for 60 minutes and you will close a percent. Like literally
47:37
the last slide just says like go over there to go buy something and you could say nothing and you will you will sell. A lot of people say that 70 60 80% of
47:44
our communication is body language. Do you think much about that? Alex, you have a with or without you energy body
47:51
language. It's a casual It's a very casual body language which in fact reinforces your authority in a way. So
47:57
do you think about if people are right that 60 or 70% of our communication is the things we don't say. Do you think
48:03
about training people on how to hold themselves, how to be you kind of alluded to something there which I think people don't think about which is
48:09
actually the less you say sometimes the higher conviction and the more I believe you. Yeah. And some people can oversell because
48:16
Yeah. So I will so I'll because I think getting so I'll just there's so many variables here but I'll just try and
48:21
focus on the ones that um a lot of people sell over the phone and even via Zoom it's harder to see body language as
48:26
well which nowadays I think a lot of selling happens in those two environments even more than in person even though that's where I came from
48:32
which I actually think is the best place to learn because you have to control every variable and then you have far
48:37
more leeway on the phone or on Zoom than you do in person and so to that extent um there's basically five things you can
48:43
control about how you talk and so you have your speed of talking like how how fast you talk. You have your cadence. You have your um basically your um your
48:51
annunciation. Like do I pronounce every letter in the words that I'm saying? You have the volume that you speak at
48:57
because if I talk too low like you on a phone, it doesn't really matter because they're just going to increase the volume. But if I lower what I'm saying
49:03
right now, it sounds more important. In person, it's more important to volume is more important in person. And so those
49:08
first three I consider there's kind of a persuasive tone which all three are constant. And the only point of those is
49:14
to maximize comprehension. It's just that they can hear you, that they can understand what you're saying because
49:20
you're talking in a speed that they can understand. Like I'm somebody who talks fast and I have to I have to pull back
49:25
how fast I talk when I'm in like a selling situation. There's only two that you that I teach sales people to try and
49:31
actively control, which is going to be pauses
49:36
to draw attention and when do I raise my voice.
49:41
And the reason that those are the only two things you really need to teach a salesperson outside of the persuasive tone, which is that that you're going to
49:47
talk at a certain speed, which usually about 150 to 170 words a minute, because that's the amount of speed that most people can understand. You're going to
49:53
enunciate the words, which is going to force you to actually speak at that speed. Um, and you're going to talk loud enough
49:58
they can understand you. This sounds very simple, right? Like this sounds like so simple. Like I can't believe
50:04
people don't do this. Except they don't and they don't close. And so the only things that you have to teach a
50:09
salesperson, and these are so important, like there's been three independent studies that are like massive meta analyses of sales people,
50:16
the sales people who one speak less close more. And number two, the sales people who know when to shut up, most
50:22
importantly, after you ask for the sale, like if you wait 8 seconds after you ask someone to buy, you close 30% more sales
50:28
if you wait 8 seconds. Yeah. So you ready to start?
50:34
Okay. So Mhm. And so people they'll like they'll close themselves, but the sales people
50:41
are so afraid of that silence that they then jump back in. It's like you had the sale, just shut up. You know what's fascinating is there are
50:47
actual studies now that show for women in particular that you make more money if you do one thing which is you wear
50:53
makeup which is wild. So they did there's three studies that have been done totally different groups. one by Harvard, one by Stanford, and I can't
50:59
remember, it was either Oxford or Cambridge. And the studies showed that women who there was no attractiveness
51:06
differential between them, but one wore makeup consistently uh at work and one didn't, they made anywhere from 20 to
51:13
40% more money inside of this study. What I thought was really interesting about that, because I'm not really
51:18
historically a makeup girl, although being fully face painted for this, is that that actually makes sense in a lot
51:23
of ways because we do have this initial reaction that we always have uh with people. you know, we judge somebody like you talked about almost immediately. And
51:30
so when I saw that study, I thought, well, first of all, that's interesting. You don't have to be smarter, better looking, uh, or anything else and you
51:37
can make more money just by the way you present yourself. And so I thought thought, well, what about the way that you dress? Is is that also the same? And
51:43
there are studies that back this as well that in fact you can make more money as a man for dressing one way and as a
51:49
woman and women are interesting because you are not the norm.
51:55
What am I missing here? You got the lumberjack. I've got 20% sitting on the table right now.
52:00
But what's fascinating is, you know, I like things where you don't have to you
52:05
don't have to be better than anybody else. You can just use human psychology to make more money. And so if I am a
52:11
woman, I know that the way that I dress, so when I pay attention to my dress and dress professionally, whatever that
52:16
means in this instance, in the study that I saw, it was like, you know what what I would have on a blouse, a suit, something like that, women make two
52:23
times more than men when they dress when they dress better. Men, it actually is less important. Still more important
52:28
though, if you dress professionally in a suit and you don't have all the other proof and things you have, you have this sort of interesting thing that's like a
52:34
you have sort of um diametric opposition. I make a lot of money and yet I care so little about money that I
52:41
dress in a white beard. Yeah. Exactly. And so and so men make somewhere between 15 and 18% more when they dress in
52:47
suits. So I think there's a a real um argument to be made for if you're going to pay attention to the way your voice
52:53
sounds. That takes some training. Doesn't take much training to change the way that you look professionally and and
52:59
how you dress. And the only other thing that I would talk about on sales and pitching is we tell all of our company
53:05
people. Um the line is show don't tell. We increasingly do not believe the things that were heard. So like think
53:10
about a sales pitch that goes like this. Um you know uh we for instance have a
53:16
lot of home service companies. So these home service companies are selling a homeowner on let's say landscaping. And
53:22
so I'm going to come and we're going to clean up your lawn and here's what we're going to do and this is how much it's going to charge. I'm going to charge and
53:28
this is how long it's going to take. And you can tell the client that we're an
53:33
expert at this. I've been in business for 42 years. We have, you know, 10,000 reviews on Trustpilot, etc. Or you could
53:39
do something that'll double your conversion, which is simply bring a phone or an iPad with you and say, "Can
53:45
I show you what we did for your neighbors down the street?" And just show them the image of it. Just go, "We
53:50
do have a thousand Trust Pilot views. I don't right here. We could see what the last one said." Click on it. Show them the Trust Pilot review. You don't have
53:56
to train that. And I really like my salespeople to not have to become experts, but to be enabled by what's
54:03
called sales enablement or technology just to show because we are a visual species. And so wherever possible, if
54:10
you want to increase your conversions, I tell my team, you are not allowed to close a sale without showing something.
54:16
Some visuals, you have to have a visual because it's just a trust transfer and a higher signal. I've got three boxes here and
54:24
these three suitcases contain different amounts of money. One of them contains
54:30
$1,000, one of them contains $10,000, and one of them contains $100,000. You're going to pick a suitcase and
54:36
you're going to tell me what you would do with that amount of money if you were starting with that amount of money today to build a scalable business.
54:44
So, do we keep the money? He wants to buy a watch. I'm like, I'm feeling hundred,000.
54:51
All right. What do we got? Oh, I have $1,000.
54:57
So, do I get to keep the money? Is that how this works? Yeah, you can keep it. Smells smells smells like money. Okay. So, I have
55:02
$1,000. So, I would um take the $1,000, put it in my pocket, do nothing with it, and I would watch YouTube videos on AI
55:09
integration into small businesses. And then I would go to small businesses and once I had a specific integration that I
55:15
would do, which I would probably bet would be around likely email list activation because that's typically like
55:21
fastest, easiest money that most business owners have is their contact list. So they've got, you know, they've been in business 10 years. They've got,
55:27
you know, 8,000 customers they've sold over that whole time period and maybe a list of, you know, call it 20,000 leads
55:33
that they've had. They never email them ever. If they do, it's just like, here's our random discount that we send once a quarter for Christmas or whatever. And I
55:39
would say, "Hey, um, I will email those people and I will, uh, get everything approved by you and don't pay me
55:45
anything. Just pay me a percentage of the sales that we generate afterwards. How's that sound?" And that offer tends
55:50
to do well. And I know that because I've done it. So that's what I would do. And the $1,000, I would, you know, go buy uh
55:55
Leila something for a little bit of time so that she can stay with me until uh I make the money for my my email
56:02
reactivation campaign. See what I get.
56:09
I got the 10K. All right, we're going around the circle here. Um, I like it.
56:16
I would find the person who would buy what I was selling for the highest dollar amount humanly possible, which
56:22
means I would probably go to private equity companies. So, Alex gave me the
56:27
idea for Main Street. I I know that Main Street businesses are like often cash crunched, right? They don't have a lot
56:32
of money and they often cannot extract enough value from a lead that I need
56:38
them to. So, Alex would need to find the perfect company to do that and there's lots of them or he would build his own which would be great. I think in my
56:45
specific instance I want to go to the people who are already good at extracting the most value humanly possible. So, I'd probably try to go to
56:50
a private equity firm and I would What's a private equity firm? It's basically a fancy way for saying that people use their own money to buy
56:56
businesses as opposed to public equity where people use the stock markets dollars to buy businesses. And so
57:03
examples would be like u you know KKR, Carlilele, uh Cberus are some of the
57:08
biggest in the world. So they go around buying people's businesses with their own money. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. They find entrepreneurs right about the point
57:14
where they cannot take it anymore and they buy those businesses and then they they grow them hugely. and and and again
57:20
because I'm better at partnerships, I would want to go to them and I would want to say and it really what's interesting is I bet all of us are going
57:25
to be really similar. The money actually doesn't matter. And so even though I
57:30
have $10,000 10x what Alex has, it doesn't actually matter because what I would do still $10,000 is not enough for
57:37
me to make a couple million, which is what I would want to do with this. So what actually is the differentiator?
57:42
What is the business model I choose? Who do I go to sell it to so that I can get the most value out of it? With these PE
57:48
companies, what I would do is I would go to them and they're buying companies all the time. And so, there's two ways to
57:54
sell to a PE company, and I'd see which ones I could get them to sign up for. On one hand, there's something called a deal sourcing fee, which is if you can
58:00
find companies that are in the niche that PE companies want to buy, they will pay you for sourcing the company. Um,
58:07
and I know this because I pay deals sourcing fees. And so, I would go to private local private equity companies.
58:12
You're not going to be able to get to Cberus or the big guys. So, I would go to the ones in my local neighborhood that you could find by searching on AI
58:17
to say local private equity companies buying these types of companies. I would reach out to the GPS, those are the
58:23
general partners of the company, the guys who run it, and I would say, what type of companies are you actively purchasing right now? What's your
58:29
investment thesis and dealbox? And if I could get them to respond to me, great. If not, I'd search, what do private
58:34
equity companies typically want to buy? What what is the deal box or investment thesis of a private equity company? I
58:40
would find that dealbox and then I'd play the game of doornocking. I'd go to a bunch of these businesses and try to find companies that wanted to sell. And
58:46
then when they tell me they want to sell and I have a buyer, which is the private equity uh company, the private equity
58:52
company will pay me either a percentage of the sale or a flat fee for sourcing it. What might that look like in terms of a
58:57
percentage and dollar number? Yeah. I mean, if you're like a a noninstitutional player doing this, I
59:03
think you would go to them and say, "Can I get like 10k for every company that I source you that's over a million dollars in revenue that's profitable and within
59:09
your dealbox?" They'd probably say yes. The normal sourcing fee is somewhere between three and 5%, but you're not
59:14
going to get that when you're brand new. So, but I like the idea of making 10K on one deal to start. Then what else am I
59:21
learning while I'm doing this? I'm also learning simultaneously how do you buy businesses? What type of businesses? How
59:26
do you find businesses for sale? I think this is the highest leverage activity I know how to do. Like I just I know more
59:32
how to buy a business that's already making money and make it make more money with a higher degree of certainty because if it's already profitable, it
59:38
gets out of the valley of death, which is where a company starts and never actually makes any profit. And so I
59:45
would start there. And then what would I do for that? Well, the second that they see that I'm good at sourcing deals, there's going to be they're going to be throwing offers at me. But what I might
59:51
do instead is go to those GPS and say, "Hey, I'm pretty good at doing the hardest part of private equity, which is
59:57
finding the deals. Why don't you guys back me for me to find the deals for you? Maybe they'll invest in my company
1:00:02
for me to then run a private equity firm. Or maybe they'll say, "Come work for me, and then I can make a couple hundred,000. I can learn what I think is
1:00:08
the best uh skill out there to learn, which is dealm, and I can use my leverage, which is knowing what a
1:00:15
company's worth and how to buy it using other people's money in order to increase uh my earnings." And that's
1:00:21
interesting. You'd both use the money for personal things, probably just pay your rent or take your time. Doesn't make a difference at that level.
1:00:26
And I mean, even the hundred is close to I mean, it's more than 10 in one, but
1:00:32
yeah. And and this is just one idea. I think there's so many things you could do with one, but they're all very similar in their
1:00:37
fundamentals. Well, you go to find some like the leverage comes from going tapping into existing networks. You find an existing
1:00:43
business and either you're selling the business as the product or you're selling the product of that business. Right. Exactly. So, you're selling
1:00:49
either way and all of it is promotion. You're selling and you're trying to get a percentage of upside. I'm getting a
1:00:54
percentage of because like to Cody's point, a lot of mainstream businesses don't have money and you're like, "Cool, pay me on money that I make you and
1:01:00
they're usually very very generous with money they don't have yet." Um, same same for, you know, a deal that
1:01:06
we haven't made yet. I'll give you, you know, a fee for those things. Again, it depends on the timeline. If I have 30 days, then like
1:01:12
getting a deal done in 30 days will be tough. Um, but like getting a brick and mortar, it's like probably do that in 48 hours
1:01:19
to get somebody to say yes to free money for like no risk and I do all the work. It's an easy offer. So again, I think it
1:01:24
dep that's where like the constraints of the initial prompt is like how much money and how much time. If it's a year,
1:01:29
it's like all of this changes. If it's 30 days and I have nothing, it's like, well, then we'd want to generate as much cash as we can in little time as
1:01:35
possible with no risk. Yeah. Daniel's about to invest in the S&P 500. Right. Because he's like, I take your your $10,000 and
1:01:42
I raise you. Yeah. So I have 100,000. So he's leaving with it.
1:01:49
This this is a dangerous amount of money. Yeah. This is the worst case scenario for most people because if you have a
1:01:55
thousand, you know, you don't have money. If you have 10,000, okay, you might get a cleaner, you might get an
1:02:01
assistant, you might do a few little things with it. The danger of a h 100,000 is you can kid yourself into
1:02:06
thinking that you've got money. And it will make your head spin how fast you can blow through $100,000 if if you
1:02:12
don't know what you're doing. If you give me a Formula One car and ask, "What am I going to do with it?" I'm gonna
1:02:18
crash it, right? if I can get it even started in the first place. So, I've got to come up with something that the first
1:02:24
problem that I have is I don't have the knowledge. I don't have the network. I don't have the reputation. So, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to
1:02:29
leverage Cody's. I'm going to go to Cody and I'm going to say, "Cody, can I do a deal with you? I would like to start a
1:02:35
business. I know you've got lots of ideas that you just don't have time for. I'm going to invest $100,000 as debt for
1:02:41
equity for 10%. So, I'm going to put 100 grand in and that'll come out of the business at some point, but debt for equity on 10%. and I'm going to do sweat
1:02:48
equity for 10% and you keep 80%. And it's your idea and it's your network and
1:02:53
it's your reputation, but I'll be the person who's heavily invested in this. And the only condition is that as the
1:03:00
business becomes profitable, we can repay the 100 grand. Um, and then once it's repaid the 100 grand, either you
1:03:06
buy it or we can sell the business. Now, what I'm doing there is I'm basically acknowledging I don't know
1:03:12
what I'm doing. I'm acknowledging I don't have the reputation. I don't have the knowledge. um all I have is this 100
1:03:17
grand and I have a very strong desire or will to be an entrepreneur. Now, what's going to happen is that probably with an
1:03:23
hour of Cody's time per month, she's going to be able to say, "Here's the idea. Here's here's my CFO. Talk to my
1:03:28
CFO. Here's my head of marketing. Talk to my head of marketing. Here's my friend who's actually got even more
1:03:34
money and wants to invest." And she's just going to like fire off a few emails and she's going to love the idea because
1:03:39
it's her idea. And I'm going to I'm going to work hard, right? And what's cool is that when the time comes that
1:03:46
that business becomes valuable, I've got one buyer on the table. Cody's either going to say, "Hey, look, I'll buy you out because it's only 20% and now I own
1:03:52
the whole thing." Uh, or we go to market and Cody will know someone who can buy the business and I get 20% of the exit.
1:03:59
So, but the key here is that just that acknowledgement that the it's really it's the knowledge, the network, and the
1:04:06
reputation that is the valuable bit. And the money is a bit of a red herring. And you're going to get Cody's skills because you're going to be in her
1:04:11
proximity. you're going to get a little bit of her reputation at the end of that deal. I will then have knowledge. I'll then have
1:04:18
reputation. I'll then have uh all of those things will have leveled up for me. Thank you so much everybody for being
