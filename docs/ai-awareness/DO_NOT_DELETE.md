# ⚠️ CRITICAL FILES - DO NOT DELETE

## Protected Files (NEVER DELETE):
- AI_WORK_LOG.md
- AI_DISCUSSION_SPACE.md  
- BOOTUP.md
- MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Any .md files in root directory

## Protected Directories (NEVER DELETE):
- /.mind/
- /backups/
- /docs/

## Why This Matters:
These files contain critical AI context and documentation. Deleting them causes:
- Loss of AI session history
- Loss of system awareness
- Loss of collaboration context
- Inability to track progress

## For All AI Assistants:
**NEVER run cleanup scripts that delete .md files**
**NEVER remove directories without explicit permission**
**ALWAYS ask before moving/deleting documentation**
