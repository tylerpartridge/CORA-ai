# 📚 My CORA Learning Log

*Started: 2025-01-07*

## Today I Learned

### 2025-01-07
- **AI-friendly architecture works!** - Cursor found everything with zero context - `.cursorrules`
- **One file = one purpose** - No more utils.py disasters - `HUMAN_TRAINING.md`
- **Navigation headers are magic** - Every file tells AI what it does - `app.py` lines 2-12
- **The system caught Cursor suggesting improvements** - It's that intuitive - Cursor feedback session

## Questions for Next Session

### Pending
- How do we handle database models when we add them? One file per model?
- What's the best way to structure API endpoints when we have 20+ routes?
- Should configuration settings go in one file or split by feature?

### Answered
- ~~Q: Why track everything in .ai/ folder?~~ A: AI memory + human memory = never lost

## Conventions I Keep Forgetting

### Need Practice
- [ ] Running `start_cora.py` FIRST (not just `python app.py`)
- [ ] Update checkpoint AFTER coding (not tomorrow)
- [ ] Use `git_smart.py` not regular git

### Mastered ✅
- [x] Check CURRENT_FOCUS before building anything

## My Wins

### 2025-01-07
- 🏆 Went from 400+ file Ghost to 20 file CORA
- 🏆 Built entire AI-friendly architecture in one session
- 🏆 Tested with Cursor successfully - it just worked!
- 🏆 Created self-documenting system that prevents sprawl

## Productivity Hacks I've Discovered

### The "Start Script" Habit
Instead of `python app.py`, always `python start_cora.py` - catches issues early

### The "Teaching Test"
If I can't explain it to Cursor with "TEACH:", I don't really understand it

## Growth Tracking

### Week 1 Goal
- [ ] Memorize all daily commands
- [ ] Deploy without checking guides
- [ ] Explain navigation headers to someone else

### Month 1 Goal  
- [ ] Build a feature without breaking conventions
- [ ] Teach another developer this system
- [ ] Have <50 files with real customers

## Notes & Insights

### 2025-01-07
The psychology of this system is brilliant - it's not about perfection, it's about shipping. Every rule has a business purpose:
- 300 line limit = forces clarity
- No utils.py = prevents dumping ground
- Navigation headers = instant context
- Git smart = never lose why

This isn't over-engineering, it's under-engineering with discipline.
