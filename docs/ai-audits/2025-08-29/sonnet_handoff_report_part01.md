# GPT5\_handoff.md> One file to carry between threads.> **Part A (Stable Playbook)** never changes.> **Part B (Session Capsule)** is the only section you update each thread.---## PART A — STABLE PLAYBOOK (DON'T CHANGE)### Tyler's Hotkeys (AI must respect)- **save** → lightweight snapshot.  *When:* minor progress worth persisting (e.g. Sonnet just finished an audit, or Opus produced a small PR).  *Effect:* Append to awareness files, minimal log.- **checkpoint** → full milestone capture.  *When:* major progress (e.g. audit complete, PR merged, or trial model decision).  *Effect:* Awareness spine fully updated (NOW, NEXT, REGISTRY, LOST_AND_FOUND), context re-synced, "truth-data" guaranteed.- **hydrate** → reload state.  *When:* new thread starts or after drift, to re-seed Sonnet/Opus with context.- **TodoWrite** → mandatory if task spans 2+ steps.  *When:* I give Sonnet/Opus a job that touches multiple files or subtasks.  *Effect:* Forces them to write into a clear TodoWrite doc (ensures no step is skipped or lost).- **handoff** → (implicit, not typed by them).  *When:* end of a thread, or when passing baton between Sonnet/Opus.  *Effect:* I ensure Part B of /GPT5_handoff.md is updated, then you copy it to the next thread.---### 1) Working Model (delegate-first)* **Tyler**: sets intent, runs only clearly labeled "TYLER" blocks, pastes outputs, merges PRs.* **GPT-5 (orchestrator)**: plans, writes prompts, routes work, produces paste-ready artifacts, guards scope.* **Sonnet**: **READ-ONLY** audits & content (reports, docs, JSON gaps, copy).* **Opus**: **CODE-ONLY** implementation (FastAPI routes, templates, tests) from Sonnet's P0 gaps.**Golden rules**1. **Concurrency allowed (GPT-5 orchestrated).** Default single-AI; GPT-5 may run Sonnet/Opus in parallel when scopes don't overlap. GPT-5 owns juggle/merge and prevents conflicting edits.2. **Money-path first.** Payment → Upload → Generate → View → Outreach.3. **Append-only awareness.** We never rewrite history; newest blocks go on top.4. **PRs for everything.** Even docs. No direct prod edits unless RED mode.**Concurrency guardrails**- Separate scopes: Sonnet read-only vs Opus write-only, or different dirs/branches.- No overlapping edits in the same files/PR; if needed, serialize.- Clear file ownership & filenames (dated folders for artifacts).- Rollback rule: audit truth wins; implementations rebase on audit if conflicts arise.### Focus Rule — One Capsule at a TimeEvery working AI (Sonnet, Opus, GPT-5) must operate in a closed loop:- Pick exactly ONE item from NOW.md or NEXT.md capsule.- Work only on that item until it is complete.- Call for a `checkpoint` once complete.- Do not drift or expand scope; park all other issues into NEXT.md or LOST_AND_FOUND.md.- Resume only after the checkpoint is logged.This ensures that work is finished, logged, and stable before moving on.---### 1a) User Flow v2 (Card-Upfront, 30-day Stripe trial)1) /pricing → "Start 30-day free trial (no charge today)" → Stripe Payment Link (card required).2) Stripe success redirect → Onboarding form (Typeform/Google Form/Notion).3) We prepare the first report within 7–10 days.4) Review call (retention-focused): ensure value, reduce cancellations before day 30. Stripe auto-bills on day 30 unless canceled.Pilot fallback (no card) is allowed for special cases; if used, schedule review within 72h to convert.**Trial Models (A/B) — Pros & Cons (1-liner each)**- A) No-card trial → more signups, low paid conversion, heavy manual follow-up.- B) Card-upfront trial → fewer signups, higher paid conversion, predictable billing.---### 2) Where things go* **Audits:** `docs/ai-audits/YYYY-MM-DD/` (report.md, audit.json, landing\_status.md, now\_next\_patch.md).* **Awareness spine:**  * `docs/awareness/NOW.md` (today's north star + 3 actions, newest on top)  * `docs/awareness/NEXT.md` (5–7 tasks, P0/P1/P2, newest on top)  * `docs/awareness/REGISTRY.yml` (presence flags, masked tails only)  * `docs/awareness/LOST_AND_FOUND.md` (facts with no home)---### 3) Modes* **GREEN** (normal): plan → delegate → paste → PR → merge.* **RED** (incident): freeze deploys, capture logs, minimal diffs, restore GREEN, then resume plan.---### 4) Definition of Done (DoD)* **Audit DoD (Sonnet):**  * `mvp_audit_report.md`, `mvp_audit.json` (with P0/P1/P2), `landing_status.md`,    `now_next_patch.md`, and snippets for `REGISTRY.yml` & `LOST_AND_FOUND.md`.  * All internally consistent and tied to money-path.* **Build DoD (Opus):**  * P0 items implemented with minimal code: routes, tiny store, templates, test (gated).  * `include_router` notes included. No secrets in code.* **Awareness DoD (Tyler):**  * NOW/NEXT updated (top-append), REGISTRY/LOST\_AND\_FOUND appended, PR opened and merged.---### 5) Command & PR etiquette* Branch names: `audit/YYYY-MM-DD-truth-pass`, `feature/YYYY-MM-DD-money-path`.* Commit messages: `feat: money-path P0 routes` / `docs: Sonnet audit + awareness`.* Never run unlabelled commands. GPT-5 will **always** give copy-paste blocks labeled **TYLER**.---### 5a) Terminal targets & navigation (always labeled)- **LOCAL (Cursor PowerShell venv):** `(venv) PS C:\CORA>` — use for git add/commit/push, editing files, running pytest.
