# MISSION.md & MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md Location Audit
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Purpose:** Identify canonical locations and resolve duplication issues  
**Auditor:** Opus

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Finding: MISSION.md Does Not Exist
- **MISSION.md**: ❌ FILE NOT FOUND in entire repository
- **MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md**: ⚠️ DUPLICATED (2 copies with conflict)

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Create MISSION.md in canonical location
2. Resolve MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md duplication
3. Update all references to point to canonical paths

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### 1. MISSION.md Status

**Search Results:**
- No file named `MISSION.md` exists anywhere in the repository
- No variants found (`Mission.md`, `mission.md`)
- Referenced in GPT5_handoff.md as required for bootup
- NOT referenced in BOOTUP.md

**Alternative Found:**
- `/awareness/IDENTITY.md` contains mission-like content:
  - WHO: Tyler Partridge (founder)
  - WHAT: CORA product definition
  - WHY: Mission statement
  - VALUES: Core principles
- This appears to be the closest existing mission document

### 2. MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md Status

**Files Found:**
| Path | Last Modified | Size | Content |
|------|---------------|------|---------|
| `/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` | 2025-08-29 14:34:17 | 37 bytes | Redirect only |
| `/docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` | 2025-08-29 14:28:16 | Full content | Complete MVP requirements |

**Root File Content:**
```
docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md
```
*This is a redirect/pointer file, not the actual requirements*

**References Found:**
- BOOTUP.md line 12: Points to `docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- BOOTUP.md line 41: Points to `docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- GPT5_handoff.md: Listed as required bootup file (no path specified)

### 3. Root Directory Analysis

**Current Root Files (6/6 at capacity):**
1. BOOTUP.md
2. GPT5_handoff.md
3. MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md (redirect only)
4. NO_TOOL_BACKUPS.md
5. OPERATIONS.md
6. README.md

**Root Directory Status:** ❌ AT CAPACITY (6 files max per SYSTEM_RULES.md)

### 4. Directory Structure Context

**Awareness Consolidation Status:**
- Primary awareness location: `/docs/awareness/`
- Legacy location: `/docs/ai-awareness/` (still has files)
- Alternative found: `/awareness/` (contains IDENTITY.md)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. MISSION.md Creation & Placement

**Recommended Action:** Create new MISSION.md
**Canonical Location:** `/docs/awareness/MISSION.md`

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with awareness consolidation under `/docs/awareness/`
- Root is at capacity (cannot add new files)
- Consistent with other awareness documents

**Content Source Options:**
1. Extract mission content from `/awareness/IDENTITY.md`
2. Request mission statement from Tyler
3. Generate from existing project documentation

### 2. MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md Resolution

**Recommended Action:** Single canonical file
**Canonical Location:** `/docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` (current)

**Migration Path:**
1. Keep `/docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` as canonical (for now)
2. Remove root redirect file `/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Update GPT5_handoff.md to specify full path
4. Future: Migrate to `/docs/awareness/` when appropriate

**Rationale:**
- BOOTUP.md already points to `/docs/ai-awareness/` location
- File has full content at this location
- Root redirect serves no purpose and wastes root slot

### 3. Updated File References

**GPT5_handoff.md should specify:**
```markdown
□ docs/awareness/MISSION.md  
□ docs/ai-awareness/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md  
```

**BOOTUP.md should add:**
```markdown
- /docs/awareness/MISSION.md  # Core mission and values
```

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Create `/docs/awareness/MISSION.md` with proper mission content
- [ ] Delete root `/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` redirect file
- [ ] Update GPT5_handoff.md with canonical paths
- [ ] Update BOOTUP.md to reference MISSION.md

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Confirm all 9 bootup files exist at specified paths
- [ ] Test bootup procedure with correct file locations
- [ ] Verify no broken references remain

## APPENDIX: Search Commands Used

```bash
# Find all MISSION.md variants
find . -name "MISSION.md" -o -name "Mission.md" -o -name "mission.md"

# Find all MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md files
find . -name "MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md" -type f

# Check file timestamps
stat -c "Modified: %y" [filename]

# Search for references
grep -r "MISSION\.md\|MVP_REQUIREMENTS\.md" --include="*.md"
```

## CONCLUSION

The repository lacks a proper MISSION.md file despite it being listed as required for GPT-5 bootup. MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md exists but has unnecessary duplication with a root redirect file. Both issues should be resolved immediately to ensure proper bootup procedures and maintain repository organization standards.

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** HIGH (blocks proper GPT-5 bootup)
**Risk:** LOW (documentation only, no code changes)
