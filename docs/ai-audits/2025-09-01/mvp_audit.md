## 4. Risk & Rollback

### Current Deployment Strategy
- **Batch Deploy Policy**: Deploys at 12:30 and 17:30 UTC
- **Health Checks**: `/health` and `/api/status` endpoints
- **Rollback Method**: Git revert + PM2 restart
- **Monitoring**: Basic smoke tests, manual verification deferred

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: All core functionality auto-tested
- **Medium Risk**: Manual verification deferred until comprehensive review
- **Mitigation**: Batch deployment allows controlled rollback if issues arise
