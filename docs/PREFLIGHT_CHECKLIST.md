# ‚úàÔ∏è MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

## STOP! Before ANY File Operation:

### üìã THE CHECKLIST (Must Complete IN ORDER)
```
[ ] 1. TYPE: "Checking SYSTEM_RULES.md..." (and actually read it)
[ ] 2. SEARCH: Does this file/function already exist?
[ ] 3. VERIFY: Is this the correct directory?
[ ] 4. DECIDE: Edit vs Create
       - Can this functionality go in ANY existing file? ‚Üí EDIT
       - Is there ANY file handling related features? ‚Üí EDIT  
       - Would creating a new file be better architecture? ‚Üí STILL EDIT
       - No related files exist anywhere? ‚Üí ONLY THEN create
[ ] 5. ANNOUNCE: "Creating/Editing [filename] in [directory]"
[ ] 6. CONFIRM: "Pre-flight complete. Proceeding with [action]"
