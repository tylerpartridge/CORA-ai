# Claude's System Audit Findings

## Executive Summary
**System Health: 20% Functional** 
- Core web server works ✓
- Business logic completely broken ✗
- Data infrastructure intact ✓
- Development tools partially working ⚠️

## Critical Breaks That Block Progress

### 1. **Missing Route Modules** (Severity: CRITICAL)
- `/routes/` directory is completely empty
- 13+ route files referenced but don't exist:
  - auth_coordinator, payment_coordinator, expense_coordinator
  - dashboard_routes, health_score_routes, export_routes
  - quickbooks_auth_routes, onboarding_routes, etc.

### 2. **Missing Business Logic** (Severity: CRITICAL)
- All `/tools/` AI modules missing:
  - security_config.py
  - async_pattern_extractor.py
  - agent_prompter.py
  - research_prompter.py

### 3. **Empty Core Directories** (Severity: HIGH)
- `/models/` - No database models
- `/middleware/` - No rate limiting or security
- `/tools/agents/` - Empty subdirectories
- `/tools/context/modules/` - Empty

## Working Components We Can Build On

### 1. **Basic Web Infrastructure** ✓
- FastAPI server starts and responds
- Static file serving works
- Basic routing functional
- API documentation auto-generated

### 2. **Data Layer** ✓
- **Databases exist and have data:**
  - cora.db: 16 users, 235 expenses, subscriptions
  - claude_memory.db: AI memory storage
  - comprehensive_logs.db: Event logging
- **Configuration ready:**
  - .env properly configured
  - Stripe test keys present
  - Email service configured (disabled)

### 3. **Minimal Functionality** ✓
- Email capture endpoint works
- Health check endpoint works
- Landing page serves correctly
- Static assets load properly

## Root Cause Analysis

The system was destroyed by an aggressive file-splitting operation that:
1. Moved code from monolithic app.py to separate modules
2. **Never created the actual module files**
3. Left only empty directories and broken imports
4. Resulted in ~80% code loss

## Data Infrastructure Report

### Existing Data Assets:
- **User data**: 16 registered users with hashed passwords
- **Financial data**: 235 expense records, 4 subscriptions
- **Beta recruitment**: 20 tracked beta users
- **Configuration**: Complete .env with all service keys
- **Test results**: Multiple phase1 validation reports

### Database Schema Intact:
- Users, Customers, Subscriptions tables
- Expenses with auto-categorization
- Proper security (BCrypt hashing, JWT ready)

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Restore from Backups
- Check version control for previous commits
- Look for archive files with original code
- Time estimate: 1-2 days if backups exist

### Option 2: Rebuild Missing Components  
- Use app_backup_broken.py as reference
- Recreate routes based on imports
- Implement basic versions first
- Time estimate: 1-2 weeks

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep working minimal version
- Add features incrementally
- Don't recreate all at once
- Time estimate: Ongoing

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Restore Authentication** - Users can't log in
2. **Basic Routes** - Dashboard, expenses, settings
3. **Database Models** - To interact with existing data
4. **Payment Processing** - For subscriptions
