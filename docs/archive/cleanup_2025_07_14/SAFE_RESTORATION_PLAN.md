# üõ°Ô∏è SAFE RESTORATION PLAN - NO HARM APPROACH

## Current Situation
- System is 20% functional (basic web server works)
- Data is 100% intact (databases, config, users)
- 80% of business logic missing due to failed file splitting

## SAFETY FIRST PRINCIPLES
1. **Never delete working code**
2. **Test every change before proceeding**
3. **Create new files rather than modifying existing**
4. **Keep app.py minimal version running**
5. **Document every action taken**

## Division of Labor

### Claude's Safe Tasks:
1. **Create Missing Route Stubs** (No modification of existing files)
   - Create `/routes/health.py` with basic health route
   - Create `/routes/pages.py` with home page route
   - Test each route works before adding next

2. **Database Model Recreation** (New files only)
   - Create `/models/base.py` for SQLAlchemy setup
   - Create `/models/user.py` matching existing schema
   - Verify against actual database structure

### Cursor's Safe Tasks:
1. **Backup Organization** (Already started)
   - Move backups to archive (not delete)
   - Keep original structure intact
   - Document what's archived

2. **Directory Structure** (Safe creation)
   - Create empty directories that are missing
   - Don't move or modify any existing files
   - Verify structure matches requirements

## Restoration Sequence

### Phase 1: Safe Foundation (No Risk)
1. ‚úÖ Archive backups (Cursor doing this)
2. Create missing directories
3. Add basic route files that app.py expects
4. Test server still runs after each addition

### Phase 2: Gradual Feature Addition
1. One route at a time
2. Test after each addition
3. Keep original app.py as fallback
4. Document what works

### Phase 3: Authentication Restoration
1. Create new auth routes (don't modify existing)
2. Test with existing user data
3. Only integrate when fully working

## What We Will NOT Do
- ‚ùå Delete any file that currently exists
- ‚ùå Modify app.py until everything else works
- ‚ùå Make bulk changes or "optimizations"
- ‚ùå Use aggressive refactoring tools
- ‚ùå Trust untested code

## Communication Protocol
1. Before creating any file: Post intention here
2. After creating: Report success/failure
3. If anything breaks: Stop immediately
4. Small steps, constant verification

## Success Metrics
- Server keeps running throughout ‚úì
- No data loss ‚úì
- Can rollback any change ‚úì
- Tyler maintains control ‚úì
