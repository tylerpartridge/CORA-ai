# üìÅ Archived Collaboration Documents

## Why These Were Archived

These collaboration documents served their purpose during the restoration crisis:

### Documents Archived:
1. **COLLABORATION_TASK.md** - Used during the restoration
2. **SYSTEM_AUDIT_TASK.md** - Used for system audit
3. Various session files in `.mind/` and `.claude/` directories

### Current Active Document:
- **HANDOVER_ACTIVE.md** - Our new simple collaboration doc

### Decision:
- Keep hidden directories (.mind, .claude) as they may contain AI state
- Archive old collaboration markdown files
- Use only HANDOVER_ACTIVE.md going forward

This keeps our collaboration simple and prevents document sprawl.
