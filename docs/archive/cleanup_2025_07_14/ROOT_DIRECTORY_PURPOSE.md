# 📁 Root Directory Purpose & Structure

## The Root Directory is Our Command Center

The root directory serves as the **active workspace** for tracking:

### 🎯 Active State Files (Should Always Be in Root):
1. **NOW.md** - What we're actively working on
2. **NEXT.md** - Task queue and priorities  
3. **STATUS.md** - Current system status
4. **README.md** - Project overview
5. **ANTI_SPRAWL_RULES.md** - Active development rules
6. **app.py** - Main application entry

### 📋 Essential Config Files:
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- `.gitignore` - Git configuration
- `.cursorrules` - Editor configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### ❌ What Should NOT Be in Root:
- Test files → `/tests/`
- Documentation → `/docs/`
- Old reports → `/docs/archive/`
- Utility scripts → `/tools/`
- Temporary files → Delete or archive

## Current Root Status:

The root directory is now properly serving its purpose as the command center while staying organized.
