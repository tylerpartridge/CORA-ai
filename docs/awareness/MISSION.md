# MISSION

**SOURCE:** Extracted from /awareness/IDENTITY.md

CORA exists to simplify expense tracking for blue-collar workers, specifically construction contractors who hate complex software. We provide dead simple, voice-first, mobile-optimized tools that enable contractors to capture expenses in under 30 seconds—whether they're in the field, in their truck, or on a job site. Our AI-powered system uses QR codes, OCR receipt scanning, and voice input to make financial tracking as effortless as possible for workers who need to see their money path clearly.

## Principles

- **Bulletproof over Features** - Reliability and stability before new capabilities
- **Simple over Complex** - Dead simple interfaces that work on any phone
- **Working over Perfect** - Ship working solutions, iterate based on real usage
- **User Feedback over Assumptions** - Parking lot demos and real contractor input drive decisions
- **Money-path First** - Pay → Upload → Generate → View → Outreach (core workflow priority)

## Definition of Done (Mission Lens)

- A contractor can capture an expense in under 30 seconds using voice, photo, or QR code
- The system works reliably on mobile devices in field conditions
- Financial data is immediately visible and actionable (no complex reports)
- Daily active usage shows 30-day retention (contractors actually use it)
- Users provide unprompted success stories about time saved and money found
