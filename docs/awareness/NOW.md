### Decision Note â€” Off-site Backups
- Status: **Deferred**
- Rationale: Prioritize launch; current on-box backups + restore drill provide acceptable coverage pre-revenue.
- Revisit Trigger: First paying customer **or** post-launch checkpoint.
- Current Focus: **Manual Walkthrough (end-to-end money-path)**.
