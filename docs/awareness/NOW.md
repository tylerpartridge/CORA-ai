- Security hardening completed
- All critical fixes implemented

**Next action:** Complete Git setup and begin beta user acquisition.

- **Deploy (Production)**: see scripts/Invoke-CoraDeploy.ps1 + docs/runbooks/DEPLOY.md (batch windows 12:30 / 17:30 UTC). Smokes: /health, /api/status.


### Decision Note â€” Off-site Backups
- Status: **Deferred**
- Rationale: Prioritize launch; current on-box backups + restore drill provide acceptable coverage pre-revenue.
- Revisit Trigger: First paying customer **or** post-launch checkpoint.
- Current Focus: **Manual Walkthrough (end-to-end money-path)**.
## 2025-09-10T02:52Z â€” Monitoring GREEN; CI trigger gating merged (Smoke=manual; Deploy/Release=manual+tags).
