**Next Action (AM): Comprehensive Manual Walkthrough**
- Note: Full end-to-end UI validation; Tyler will run fresh.

**BI Follow-ups (light)**
- Add `manual_notes` placeholders for QBO and Jobber in registry.yml (no invented prices; placeholders only) so fallback engages without fabricating values.
- Schedule weekly snapshot (Windows Task Scheduler) with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`, run to `docs/bi/<YYYY-MM-DD>/snapshot.log`.
- Evidence triage: review QBO/Jobber *_error.html for pricing cues; record any human-confirmed prices in `manual_notes` with date/source.

## ðŸ“Š Post-Walkthrough Audit Pipeline (2025-09-02)

1. **Code Refactor Queue (P0)**
   - Split oversized files (>300 lines) starting with:
     - routes/expenses.py
     - services/emotional_intelligence.py
     - web/static/js/onboarding-ai-wizard.js
   - Follow the export_manager.js pattern (modular splits, preserve API).

2. **Infra P0 Fixes**
   - Add rollback script for failed deploys.
   - Integrate DB migrations into deploy flow.
   - Schedule automated backups (daily, 7-day retention).

3. **UX Copy Rewrite Sprint**
   - Standardize "Skip for now" terminology.
   - Remove intimidating "AI-powered" jargon.
   - Fix CORA vs Cora inconsistency.
   - Rewrite onboarding, dashboard, and email flows for contractor clarity.

4. **Business Model Corrections**
   - Restructure pricing tiers (Solo $29, Crew $69, Business $149).
   - Extend trial to 60 days.
   - Implement crew invitation loop.
   - Tighten value prop messaging (voice entry, mobile-first, save every receipt).

5. **AI Workflow Hardening**
   - Implement session capsule rotation in GPT5_handoff.md.
   - Protect awareness docs from deletion.
   - Clarify save vs checkpoint criteria.
