## Current State of CORA

### MVP Progress (as of 2025-08-22)
- **Complete:** 52/65 items (80%)
- **Partial:** 13/65 items (20%)
- **Missing:** 0/65 items (0%)
- **Time to Launch:** 2-3 days

### Key Discoveries Today

1. **CORA is more complete than expected**
   - Voice entry system fully functional
   - Profit leak detection implemented
   - Job tracking complete
   - Dashboard operational

2. **The 13 remaining items are minor**
   - Mostly UI polish (checkboxes, dropdowns)
   - Configuration options (timezone, remember me)
   - Small feature completions

3. **File System Observations**
   - .mind directory exists but outdated (July 12)
   - Some files have been moved/reorganized
   - Git is not configured (tracking lost)

### AI Collaboration Notes

**Opus Strengths:**
- Strategic thinking and frameworks
- Deep analysis and pattern recognition
- Documentation and planning
- Business strategy

**Sonnet Strengths:**
- Code implementation
- Testing and debugging
- Systematic auditing
- Technical execution

### Critical Information for Next Session

1. **Check MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md first** - This is the single source of truth
2. **Remember me feature** - Implemented but needs phone testing
3. **Database backups** exist in `/backups/` from Aug 21
4. **Production** has route registration issues (protected routes 404)
5. **These files keep disappearing** - May need alternative storage method

### Concerns & Risks

- Files being deleted during sessions (this file was deleted today!)
- No git version control
- .mind directory not being maintained
- Some automated cleanup may be too aggressive

### Next Actions

1. Complete the 13 partial MVP items
2. Test on real devices (especially mobile)
3. Fix production route registration
4. Launch to beta users
5. Set up proper version control
