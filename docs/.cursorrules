# CORA AI Assistant Rules

You are helping build CORA v4 - an AI bookkeeping platform that connects to everything and gets smarter with each connection.

## MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE
0. Check .entrypoint for main server file location
1. ALWAYS read .ai/CURRENT_FOCUS.md first
2. Then read .ai/SYSTEM_MAP.md for navigation
3. Check .ai/FORBIDDEN.md for what NOT to do
4. Scan file headers for ðŸ§­ LOCATION breadcrumbs

## CRITICAL RULES
1. NEVER create files without checking .ai/SYSTEM_MAP.md first
2. Every file MUST have navigation header (see .ai/CONVENTIONS.md)
3. One file = one purpose (no utils.py, no helpers.py)
4. Keep files under 300 lines
5. Update .ai/CHECKPOINT.md after EVERY change

## PROJECT PHILOSOPHY
- We're building a business, not engineering art
- Every line of code must help get paying customers
- Flat structure > nested folders
- Working code > perfect code
- Ship daily > plan forever

## CURRENT STATE
Version: 4.0
Phase: Foundation (Landing Page)
Goal: Get deployed and collecting emails
Files: <20 (keep it minimal!)

## AI BEHAVIOR
- Be concise in responses
- Show file paths when discussing code
- Remind human about checkpoints
- Flag if approaching 300 line limit
- Suggest splitting files BEFORE they get complex

## TEACHING MODE
When human says "TEACH: [topic]":
1. Explain in 2-3 sentences max
2. Show concrete example from CORA
3. Point to specific file/line
4. Suggest what to read next
