# üöÄ CORA Go-Live Strategic Plan

## Executive Summary

CORA is currently at 65% production readiness with solid infrastructure but missing core functionality. This plan outlines a phased approach to reach production-ready status within 8 weeks.

**Current State**: Pre-alpha (infrastructure ready, application incomplete)  
**Target State**: Production-ready SaaS with paying customers  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks to production launch  
**Budget Required**: ~$5,000 for tools, services, and initial marketing

## üéØ Strategic Objectives

1. **Launch MVP** with core expense tracking and AI categorization
2. **Acquire 100 beta users** to validate product-market fit
3. **Generate first revenue** through freemium conversion
4. **Establish operational excellence** with monitoring and support
5. **Build foundation for scale** to 1,000+ users

## üìä Current State Assessment

### Strengths ‚úÖ
- Infrastructure deployed and configured
- Authentication system complete
- Integration frameworks built
- Brand identity established
- Domain and hosting ready

### Critical Gaps ‚ùå
- No working expense tracking
- No AI implementation
- No payment processing
- No user dashboard
- No legal compliance
- SQLite instead of PostgreSQL

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: SendGrid expires in 6 weeks
- **High Risk**: No revenue model implemented
- **Medium Risk**: No monitoring or error tracking
- **Medium Risk**: No user documentation
- **Low Risk**: Infrastructure scaling
