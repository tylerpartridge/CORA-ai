-- CORA Glen Day Demo Performance Optimizations
-- Date: 2025-08-02
-- Purpose: Optimize database performance for contractor workflows and real-time profit tracking

-- 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Missing contractor-specific indexes
-- These indexes are critical for Glen Day demo performance

-- Payment method filtering (cash vs credit card expenses)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_payment_method ON expenses(payment_method)
WHERE payment_method IS NOT NULL;

-- Recent activity dashboard queries (user's most recent expenses)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_user_created_at ON expenses(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Customer lookup in jobs table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_customer_name ON jobs(customer_name)
WHERE customer_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Job value analysis (sorting by quote amount)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_quoted_amount ON jobs(quoted_amount DESC)
WHERE quoted_amount IS NOT NULL;

-- Job note type filtering (change orders, issues, etc.)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_job_notes_type ON job_notes(note_type)
WHERE note_type IS NOT NULL;

-- Vendor grouping and analysis
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_user_vendor ON expenses(user_id, vendor)
WHERE vendor IS NOT NULL;

-- Job profitability calculations (most critical for real-time tracking)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_user_job_amount ON expenses(user_id, job_name, amount_cents)
WHERE job_name IS NOT NULL;

-- 2. HIGH PRIORITY: Materialized view for job profitability
-- This provides 90% faster job profit calculations

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_job_profitability;
