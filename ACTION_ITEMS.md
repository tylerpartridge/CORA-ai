# 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS FOR CORA BETA LAUNCH

**System Status:** ✅ BETA READY (with caveats) - Core features working but critical gaps exist  
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - These actions required before real users

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED FIRST

Based on comprehensive system analysis, these MUST be fixed:

### 1. **Email Service Implementation** (BLOCKER)
- SendGrid API key exists but NO email sending code
- Users cannot reset passwords
- See `CRITICAL_FIXES_BEFORE_MANUAL_TESTING.md` for quick implementation

### 2. **Replace Hardcoded Secrets** (SECURITY CRITICAL)
- SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key-here" in auth_service.py
- SendGrid API key exposed in code
- Generate new secure keys immediately

### 3. **Add Legal Documents** (LEGAL REQUIREMENT)
- No Terms of Service
- No Privacy Policy  
- Create basic versions before accepting users

### 4. **Add Data Export** (USER REQUIREMENT)
- No way to export expenses
- Add basic CSV export endpoint
- Required for business use
