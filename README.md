- **Tax Planning** - Proactive tax strategy, not just filing
- **Bookkeeping** - Yes, she does this too, brilliantly
- **Legal Advisory** - Business structure, compliance, contracts
- **AI Integration** - Native compatibility with all AI systems

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built with simplicity and scale in mind:
- FastAPI backend
- Clean 5-file root structure
- AI-first API design
- Human-AI collaborative workspace (.mind/)

## üí≥ Stripe Payment Configuration

CORA supports Stripe Payment Links for subscription CTAs on the pricing page.

### Environment Variables

Configure these in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Generic payment link (applies to all plans if specific ones aren't set)
PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/your_generic_payment_link

# Plan-specific payment links (optional, override generic)
PAYMENT_LINK_SOLO=https://buy.stripe.com/your_solo_plan_link
PAYMENT_LINK_CREW=https://buy.stripe.com/your_crew_plan_link
PAYMENT_LINK_BUSINESS=https://buy.stripe.com/your_business_plan_link
```

### Fallback Behavior

- If payment links are configured, CTAs will open Stripe Payment Links in a new tab
- If no payment links are set, CTAs fallback to `/signup?plan=PLANNAME`
- Plan-specific links override the generic PAYMENT_LINK
