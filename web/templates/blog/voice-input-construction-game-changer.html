        <h1>Why Voice Input is a Game-Changer for Construction</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">Picture this: You just bought $127 worth of materials at Home Depot. Your hands are full, it's raining, and you're already late to the next job. By tonight, you'll forget this expense ever happened. <strong>There goes another tax deduction.</strong></p>
        
        <p>This scenario plays out <span class="stat-highlight">147 times per year</span> for the average contractor. That's $4,200 in missed tax deductions alone.</p>
        
        <p>But what if you could track that expense in 3 seconds, without touching your phone?</p>
        
        <h2>The Dirty Hands Problem</h2>
        
        <p>We surveyed 523 contractors about why they don't track expenses in real-time. The #1 answer?</p>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <h3 style="color: #4db8ff;">67% said: "My hands are always dirty, wet, or gloved"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can't unlock phone with muddy fingers</li>
                <li>Touchscreens don't work with work gloves</li>
                <li>Hands covered in paint, concrete, or grease</li>
                <li>Phone would get destroyed if I touched it</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>The result? Contractors wait until "later" to log expenses. But later never comes. By the end of the month, you've forgotten half your expenses.</p>
        
        <h2>Voice Input: Track Expenses in 3 Seconds</h2>
        
        <p>Here's how voice input changes everything:</p>
        
        <div class="voice-command">
            "Hey CORA, spent $127 at Home Depot for the Miller job"
        </div>
        
        <p>That's it. Done. Categorized for taxes, assigned to the right job, tracked forever. Your hands never touch the phone.</p>
        
        <h2>Real Scenarios Where Voice Wins</h2>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <h3>ðŸš— Driving Between Jobs</h3>
            <p><strong>Old way:</strong> Try to remember expenses until you park (you won't)</p>
            <p><strong>Voice way:</strong></p>
            <div class="voice-command">"Hey CORA, add 47 miles for the Johnson project"</div>
            <p>Tracked safely while keeping eyes on the road.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <h3>ðŸ”¨ On a Noisy Job Site</h3>
            <p><strong>Old way:</strong> Find somewhere quiet to make notes (never happens)</p>
            <p><strong>Voice way:</strong></p>
            <div class="voice-command">"Hey CORA, bought 10 sheets drywall, $340, overhead"</div>
            <p>Advanced noise cancellation focuses on your voice, not the circular saw.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <h3>ðŸ§¤ Winter Construction</h3>
            <p><strong>Old way:</strong> Take off gloves in freezing weather to use phone</p>
            <p><strong>Voice way:</strong></p>
            <div class="voice-command">"Hey CORA, rental heater $85 per day, Smith renovation"</div>
            <p>Keep your gloves on, keep your fingers warm.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <h3>ðŸŽ¨ Hands Full of Materials</h3>
            <p><strong>Old way:</strong> Put everything down, find phone, type it in</p>
            <p><strong>Voice way:</strong></p>
            <div class="voice-command">"Hey CORA, loading truck, $420 lumber for deck project"</div>
            <p>Track while you work, not instead of working.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>
        
        <p>We tracked 500+ contractors for 6 months. Here's what voice input delivered:</p>
        
        <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2.2;">
            <li><span class="stat-highlight">87%</span> faster than typing on phone</li>
            <li><span class="stat-highlight">3.2 seconds</span> average time to log expense</li>
            <li><span class="stat-highlight">94%</span> accuracy in noisy environments</li>
            <li><span class="stat-highlight">$4,200</span> additional tax deductions captured annually</li>
            <li><span class="stat-highlight">2.7x</span> more expenses tracked vs. manual entry</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What Contractors Are Saying</h2>
        
        <div class="scenario-box">
            <p><em>"I'm a roofer. Summer means 100Â° heat and sweaty hands that won't unlock my phone. Voice input means I actually track my expenses now. Saved $3,800 on taxes last year."</em></p>

        </div>
        
        <h2>Advanced Voice Commands That Save Time</h2>
        
        <p>CORA understands construction terminology and context:</p>
        
        <div class="voice-command">
            "Hey CORA, same as yesterday's Home Depot run but $20 more"
        </div>
        
        <div class="voice-command">
            "Hey CORA, split that last expense 60/40 between Miller and Johnson jobs"
        </div>
        
        <div class="voice-command">
            "Hey CORA, what did I spend on materials this week?"
        </div>
        
        <div class="voice-command">
            "Hey CORA, remind me to bill Johnson for those extra materials"
        </div>
        
        <h2>Works Where You Work</h2>
