        <h1>How Real-Time Tracking Saved My Construction Business</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">My name is Mike Thompson. I'm a general contractor in Denver. Eighteen months ago, I was three weeks away from closing my business. Today, I'm more profitable than ever. <strong>This is the story of how real-time tracking saved everything I'd built.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
        
        <p>January 2024. I was sitting in my truck outside Home Depot, staring at my bank balance: <strong>$1,247</strong>. Payroll was due in 5 days: <strong>$8,400</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>I'd just finished three big jobs. Should have made $45,000 profit. Instead, I was broke.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3 style="color: #FF5252;">The Terrifying Reality:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Busy all year, but no money in the bank</li>
                <li>Couldn't figure out where profits went</li>
                <li>Spreadsheets showed I should be profitable</li>
                <li>Reality: losing $3-5k per job</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>I wasn't alone. 62% of construction businesses fail within 5 years. Most never know what hit them.</p>
        
        <h2>The Spreadsheet Lie</h2>
        
        <p>Every Sunday night, I'd update my spreadsheets. Everything looked fine on paper:</p>
        
        <div class="profit-box">
            <h4>Johnson Bathroom Remodel (What My Spreadsheet Said):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contract: $28,000</li>
                <li>Materials: $11,000</li>
                <li>Labor: $8,000</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Profit: $9,000 (32%)</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>But spreadsheets only show what you remember to enter. And I was forgetting a lot.</p>
        
        <h2>The Real-Time Reality Check</h2>
        
        <p>In desperation, I started tracking every expense in real-time with CORA. Within 48 hours, I discovered the truth:</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h4>Johnson Bathroom Remodel (The Real Numbers):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contract: $28,000</li>
                <li>Materials (initial): $11,000</li>
                <li><strong>Materials (additional runs): $2,847</strong> ← Never tracked these</li>
                <li>Labor (quoted): $8,000</li>
                <li><strong>Labor (callbacks/fixes): $1,920</strong> ← Invisible hours</li>
                <li><strong>Truck/fuel: $340</strong> ← 17 supply runs</li>
                <li><strong>Tool rental: $185</strong> ← Forgot to bill client</li>
                <li><strong>Disposal fees: $220</strong> ← Always forgot these</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Profit: $3,488 (12.4%)</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <span class="number-highlight">I lost $5,512 in profit on ONE JOB</span>
        
        <p>Multiply that by 20 jobs per year. That's $110,000 in lost profit. No wonder I was broke.</p>
        
        <h2>The First 30 Days of Truth</h2>
        
        <p>Real-time tracking revealed patterns I'd been blind to:</p>
        
        <div class="before-after">
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Week 1 Discoveries:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making 3-4 supply runs per job (not 1)</li>
                    <li>Callbacks eating 10% of labor hours</li>
                    <li>Disposal fees on EVERY job</li>
                    <li>Travel time never billed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>Week 1 Changes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Started charging for supply runs</li>
                    <li>Added disposal fees to contracts</li>
                    <li>Tracked callback hours</li>
                    <li>Billed portal-to-portal time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>By week 2, I was seeing profit warnings in real-time:</p>
        
        <div class="profit-box">
            <p style="color: #FF5252; font-weight: 600;">⚠️ CORA Alert: "Miller kitchen at 67% material budget with 40% work remaining"</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>That alert saved me $3,200. I immediately talked to the client about a change order instead of eating the cost.</p>
        
        <h2>The 90-Day Transformation</h2>
        
        <p>Three months of real-time tracking changed everything:</p>
        
        <div class="before-after">
            <div>
                <h4 style="color: #FF5252;">Before (January 2024):</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Monthly profit: -$2,000 (losing money)</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 style="color: #69F0AE;">After (April 2024):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Profit margin: 22%</li>
                    <li>Cash in bank: $31,420</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <span class="number-highlight">175% Profit Increase in 90 Days</span>
        
        <h2>The Specific Changes That Saved My Business</h2>
        
        <ol style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2.2;">
            <li><strong>Voice tracking everything:</strong> "Hey CORA, bought screws $12 for Miller job" - tracked 147 forgotten expenses in first month</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time margin monitoring:</strong> Know instantly when a job goes sideways, not 3 weeks later</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic categorization:</strong> Every expense tagged to the right job, no more guessing</li>
            <li><strong>Daily profit snapshots:</strong> See exactly how much I made (or lost) each day</li>
            <li><strong>Change order alerts:</strong> When costs exceed budget, I know immediately</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>What I Learned (The Hard Way)</h2>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>Truth #1: You're Not Tracking 40% of Your Expenses</h3>
            <p>Small stuff adds up. That $8 parking, $15 hardware store run, $30 in gas - it's killing your profits.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>Truth #2: Spreadsheets Are Always Wrong</h3>
            <p>They only show what you remember to enter. Real-time tracking shows what actually happened.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>Truth #3: You Need to Know TODAY, Not Sunday</h3>
            <p>By the time you update that spreadsheet, you've already lost money. Real-time means real profit.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>One Year Later</h2>
        
        <p>Today, August 2025, my business is unrecognizable:</p>
        
        <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2;">
            <li>Annual revenue: <strong>$1.8M</strong> (up from $750K)</li>
            <li>Net profit: <strong>24%</strong> (up from 8%)</li>
            <li>Employees: <strong>7</strong> (up from 3)</li>
            <li>Cash reserves: <strong>$127,000</strong> (up from $1,247)</li>
            <li>Stress level: <strong>Actually take weekends off now</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The difference? I know my numbers in real-time. No surprises. No mystery losses. No more sleepless nights.</p>
        
        <h2>My Advice to Every Contractor</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;">If you're busy but broke, you're not bad at construction. You're bad at tracking.</p>
        
        <p>Start tracking everything in real-time. Not tomorrow. Not Sunday. NOW. Your business depends on it.</p>
